CONSEQUENCES,VIETNAM~ @64@ IN EARLY AUGUST OF 1964~ TONKIN GULF. OFFICIAL STORY WAS THAT AN ^UNPROVOKED ATTACK^ BY NVN TORPEDO BOATS AGAINST THE WARSHIP USS MADDOX HAD TAKEN PLACE ON 8/2/64. MADDOX WAS ON AN INTEL MISSION~ A DESOTO PATROL~ IN SUPPORT OF GUERRILLA ATTACKS BY U.S. AND SVN FORCES INTO NORTHERN VIETNAM. ANOTHER IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE OF SUCH NAVAL PATROLS WAS THE PROVOCATION OF SHORE STATIONS ALONG THE NORTHERN VIETNAM COAST AND CHINA'S HAINAN ISLAND IN ORDER TO DECIPHER THE MILITARY CODES OF NVN AND PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. TEMPORARY PERSONNEL ON BOARD MADDOX INCLUDED INTEL OPERATIVES FROM U.S. NAVAL SECURITY GROUP WHO WERE CHINESE AND VIETNAMESE LANGUAGE SPECIALISTS. OFTEN~ THE ONLY WAY TO GET DESIRED FRANTIC RESPONSE WAS TO TURN THE SHIP LANDWARD~ ENTER THE TARGET NATION'S TERRITORIAL WATERS AND THEN RECORD THE VERBAL EXCITEMENT THAT RESULTED. THIS TIME~ HOWEVER~ DUE TO THE ARMED ATTACKS THAT COINCIDED WITH THE MADDOX'S INTRUSION INTO NVN'S WATERS. NVN SENT BOATS TO REPEL THE DESTROYER. THESE SMALL BOATS WERE NO MATCH FOR FIGHTER-BOMBERS SENT FROM MY SHIP~ THE USS TICONDEROGA. TWO DAYS LATER THE MADDOX AND THE USS TURNER JOY~ WERE AGAIN UNDER SUPPOSEDLY UNDER ATTACK FROM NVN TORPEDO BOATS. IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT DURING VERY HEAVY SEAS~ AND THERE WERE NO DEFINITE SIGHTINGS OF THE ^ENEMY.^ EVEN ONE OF OUR PILOTS~ COMMANDER JAMES STOCKDALE~ TOLD HIS SUPERIORS THERE WAS NO ATTACK ON THE U.S. WARSHIPS THAT NIGHT. IGNORING THESE FACTS~ THE JOHNSON-MCNAMARA TEAM DECLARED THAT THIS SECOND ^ATTACK^ HAD TAKEN PLACE. THIS WAS THE SECOND LIE. THESE TWO LIES FORMED THE BASIS FOR INCREASING DIRECT U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN THE WAR. FIRST~ ON 8/5/64~ THE FIRST OFFICIAL AIR STRIKES WERE CARRIED OUT AGAINST MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IN NVN. ON 6/7/64~ CONGRESS ADOPTED THE ^TONKIN GULF RESOLUTION~^ WHICH WOULD FUNCTION FOR THE NEXT SIX YEARS AS A BLANK CHECK FOR BOTH THE JOHNSON AND NIXON ADMS. I WORKED IN THE U.S. NAVAL SECURITY GROUP BETWEEN 1961 AND EARLY 1964. MANY OF THE INTEL PERSONNEL ON THE USS MADDOX WERE WORKMATES OF MINE WHEN I WORKED AT THE NAVAL SECURITY GROUP DETACHMENT IN TAIWAN.
