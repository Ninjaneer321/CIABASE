PSYWAR,IRAQ~ @90-99@ DESERT FOX BY HERBERT A. FRIEDMAN THE ATTACK ON IRAQ WAS LAUNCHED ON IN IRAQ FROM 12/19-19/98 FOR IRAQ'S REFUSAL TO ALLOW THE INSPECTION OF SITES AS STATED IN THE UN RESOLUTION 687. DURING THE ATTACK~ FIVE DIFFERENT ALLIED LEAFLETS WERE DROPPED. WHEN SADDAM REFUSED ENTRY TO THE UN ARMS INSPECTION TEAMS IN DECEMBER~ THE COALITION TOOK A FIRM STAND. FOUR LEAFLETS WERE PREPARED. THE FIRST LEAFLET SHOWS THE IRAQI EAGLE SYMBOL AT THE LEFT. AT THE RIGHT IS A RED TRIANGLE. THE TRIANGLE IS THE SYMBOL OF THE ELITE REPUBLICAN GUARD. OVER THE TRIANGLE THE PROPAGANDISTS HAVE PRINTED AN IMAGE OF THE KIND A SNIPER MIGHT SEE WHEN LOOKING THROUGH HIS SCOPE. THE BACK OF THE LEAFLET SHOWS A FAINTER IMAGE OF THE IRAQI EAGLE~ AND THE ARABIC TEXT ^OUR TARGETS ARE ONLY THE FORCES THAT BACK THE GOVERNMENT IN BAGHDAD. YOU ARE NOT OUR TARGET~ BUT YOU ARE UNDER OBSERVATION. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR POSITIONS. DO NOT HEAD SOUTH.^ THE SECOND LEAFLET SHOWS A DESTROYED IRAQI TANK FROM THE PERSIAN GULF WAR. AT THE UPPER RIGHT THE DATE ^1411^ IS SHOWN IN ARABIC - THIS WOULD TRANSLATE TO THE PERSIAN GULF WAR DATE OF 1991. THE TEXT ON THE SECOND LEAFLET IS AGAIN OVER A FAINT IRAQI EAGLE -- ^IRAQI SOLDIERS. MAYBE THIS WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE. DO NOT RESIST THE ALLIED FORCES. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR POSITIONS. DO NOT HEAD SOUTH. OUR GOALS ARE ONLY THE FORCES THAT BACK THE GOVERNMENT IN BAGHDAD.^ THE MIDDLE THREE LEAFLETS ALL SHOW SCENES OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION. IT APPEARS THAT SAUDI ARABIA WAS NOT CONSULTED IN REGARD TO THESE LEAFLETS. DURING THE GULF WAR~ THEY WERE STRONGLY AGAINST THESE ^ATROCITY^ LEAFLETS AND RECOMMENDED SCENES OF FRIENDLY ARABS MEETING~ EATING TOGETHER~ AND EVEN WALKING OFF INTO THE DESERT HOLDING HANDS. THE THIRD LEAFLET SHOWS A NUMBER OF DESTROYED VEHICLES ALONG THE ^HIGHWAY OF DEATH.^ THE FOURTH LEAFLET SHOWS A NUMBER OF IRAQI ARMORED VEHICLES WRECKED IN THE DESERT. MY TRANSLATORS TELL ME THAT THE ARABIC IS VERY POOR ON THIS LEAFLET AND ACTUALLY SAYS SOMETHING LIKE ^IF KUWAIT EXPANDS THEY WILL DESTROY YOU A SECOND TIME.^ THEY SAY THAT THE VERB FOR ^EXPAND^ IS POORLY CHOSEN. PERHAPS THIS IS THE REASON THE RUMORED ORIGINAL SERIES WAS REJECTED. IF THESE LEAFLETS WERE MADE WITHOUT SAUDI ARABIAN INPUT~ IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AMERICAN LINGUISTS DID NOT GET THE TEXT EXACTLY RIGHT.

PURPOSE OF,@47-99@ ARTICLE BY ROGER HILSMAN ^DOES THE CIA STILL HAVE A ROLE?^ HILSMAN FORMER OSS OFFICER AND FORMER TOP OFFICIAL OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT. EARLY IN EISENHOWER ADM~ CIA PERSUADED THE PRESIDENT AND THE NSC TO ALLOW IT TO CONDUCT COVERT ACTION OPS CITING A CLAUSE IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY ACT. RELATIVELY LITTLE INFO COMES FROM ESPIONAGE BUT OLEG PENKOVSKY MADE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCOVERY OF USSR MISSILES IN CUBA. PENKOVSKY SMUGGLED OUT A MANUAL USED IN SETTING UP MEDIUM AND INTERMEDIATE RANGE MISSILES - CLASSIFIED SECRET BUT NOT TOP SECRET. IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER ESPIONAGE WOULD HAVE MADE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN U.S. POLICY DURING THE LAST YEARS OF THE USSR. IT MORE QUESTIONABLE IF THE DIFFERENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH THE ENORMOUS COST. ESPIONAGE'S CONTRIBUTION TO WISE DECISIONS IN FOREIGN POLICY AND DEFENSE IS MINIMAL. BUT THE COST IN LIVES~ TREASURE AND INTANGIBLES IS HIGH. ALMOST EVERY EMBASSY HAS A COLLECTION OF CIA SPOOKS. GIVEN THE END OF THE COLD WAR~ ESPIONAGE IS SOMETHING THE U.S. CAN DO WITHOUT. THE COSTS EXCEED ANY POSSIBLE GAIN. IS U.S. GETS OUT OF ESPIONAGE AND COVERT POLITICAL ACTION~ IT COULD ELIMINATE ALL THE CIA CONTINGENTS IT NOW MAINTAINS~ EXCEPT THOSE PERHAPS IN LIAISON~ IN ITS EMBASSIES ALL OVER THE WORLD. DOLLAR SAVING SUBSTANTIAL~ GAIN IN POLITICAL TERMS GREATER STILL. FOREIGN AFFAIRS~ 10/95 105-13
PURPOSE OF,@93@ SENATORS~ CIA FIGHT OVER $1 BILLION. CLINTON ARGUED IT NEEDED FUNDS TO BEGIN CONSOLIDATING INTEL-GATHERING FUNCTIONS - SUCH AS REDUCING NUMBER OF SATELLITE SYSTEMS FROM 20 TO 5 AND TO CLOSE A NUMBER OF FOREIGN FACILITIES. ALSO A 17.5% REDUCTION IN PERSONNEL OVER 5 YEARS. DECONCINI'S PROPOSED ACTION WOULD SLOW SPENDING ON 2 MAJOR NEW SATELLITE SYSTEMS THAT TO PROVIDE IMPROVED BATTLEFIELD IMAGERY AND CONSOLIDATE EXISTING SATELLITES THAT EAVESDROP FROM SPACE ON FOREIGN GVT ELECTRONIC MESSAGES. BUT PROPOSAL WOULD BOOST SPENDING ON THOSE TOPICS THAT TO BE AT HEART OF INTEL COMMUNITY'S MISSION FOR 90s: NARCOTICS~ TERRORISM~ ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES~ AND ARMS PROLIFERATION. WORK FORCE TO DECEASE 17.5% BY @97@ <WP 7/16/93 A4
PURPOSE OF,@96@ DCI DEUTCH BECOMING MOST POWERFUL CIA CHIEF EVER. HE HAS NEAR VETO AUTHORITY OVER APPOINTMENTS OF PENTAGON INTEL CHIEFS AND OTHER GVT AGENCIES. DEUTCH ONLY THE SECOND DCI TO HOLD CABINET RANK. GOAL TO CONSOLIDATE CONTROL OVER 28 SEPARATE AND OFTEN FEUDING ORGS. DEUTCH WELL-CONNECTED. DCI CASEY WAS FIRST DCI WITH CABINET RANK. INTEL COMMUNITY HAS SOME 100~000 PEOPLE~ THAT WASTE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REDUNDANT SERVICES. FIVE ORGS BUY OR RUN SPY SATELLITES~ WHILE EIGHT PROCESS AND ANALYZE PHOTOS. <TIME 5/6/96 43
PURPOSE OF,@97@ NEW DCI TENET PLANS A LEANER INTEL AGENDA ON HARD TARGETS INVOLVING DRUG AND WEAPONS TRAFFICKING AND TERRORISM. SOME SEE CIA AS AN INFO CLEARING HOUSE~ A SORT OF NATIONAL SECURITY LIBRARY THAT WOULD SORT BOTH PUBLIC AND SECRET INFO IN PRODUCING INTEL ANALYSIS. ``THIS IS~ AT THE END OF THE DAY~ AN ESPIONAGE ORGANIZATION. WE MUST GENERATE INFO THAT IS UNIQUE AND MAKES A CONTRIBUTION AGAINST EACH OF THOSE TARGETS.'' CIA IS 25 PERCENT SMALLER THAN ITS COLD WAR PEAK AND ITS MISSION HAS CHANGED FROM FOCUS ON THE NOW-DEFUNCT USSR. CIA WILL CONTINUE TO USE MANY OF THE SAME BASIC TOOLS THAT IT USED IN THE COLD WAR: A COSTLY ARRAY OF SPY SATELLITES FOR IMAGERY AND EAVESDROPPING INTEL~ A BROAD BASE OF ANALYSTS TRAINED IN A VARIETY OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES~ OPS SPECIALISTS WHO RUN ACTIONS DIRECTED AGAINST FOREIGN GVTS AND ENTITIES. THE NEW DO IS JACK G. DOWNING. AP 7/22/97
PURPOSE OF,@98@ DCI TENET BELIEVES FAILURE TO FORECAST INDIA'S UNDERGROUND EXPLOSIONS TEACHES LITTLE ABOUT CIA'S TRUE SHORTCOMINGS. REAL PROBLEMS ARE WORSE: CIA'S SPIES~ ARE DEMORALIZED AFTER THE ALDRICH AMES SCANDAL~ IS DEPLETED AND INEFFECTIVE. INTEL COMMUNITY (IC) IS LOSING ITS TECHNOLOGICAL EDGE -- IN SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPHY AND EAVESDROPPING -- OVER OTHER COUNTRIES. CIA TOO OFTEN REPORTS ON THE OBVIOUS. IN HIS MAY 5 BRIEFING~ HE OUTLINED A NEW ^STRATEGIC DIRECTION^ CENTERED ON THE DIRECTORATE OF OPS (DO). TENET TO HIRE NEW CASE OFFICERS AND TO OUTFIT THEM WITH THE LATEST EQUIPMENT. THE (DO) BUDGET TO RISE. NEGLECT HAS CRIPPLED THE DO. THE AMES SCANDAL~ BUDGET CUTS~ POOR PLANNING~ AND DEPARTURE OF TALENTED OFFICERS HAVE RAVAGED THE DO. THOSE WHO REMAIN [ARE] TIMID. MISSION~ TOO~ HAS CHANGED: COUNTING SOVIET MISSILES HAS GIVEN WAY TO CRACKING TERRORIST CELLS. ^YOU WANT A DIFFERENT PERSON THAN THE WHITE MALE POSING AS A STATE OFFICER WHO GOES TO COCKTAIL PARTIES AND TRIES TO RECRUIT A RUSSIAN~^ SAYS A TOP ADM OFFICIAL. ^YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS BUSINESS~ KNOWS COMPUTERS~ CAN SPEAK OBSCURE MIDDLE EAST DIALECTS~ AND DOESN'T HAVE WHITE SKIN.^ ON THE EVE OF THE BALKAN WAR~ IT PUBLISHED A PAPER ON YUGOSLAVIA'S PROSPECTS FOR THE 1990S ENTITLED ^A DECADE OF GROWTH?^ TROUBLE IN THE DO HAS LONG BEEN OFFSET BY ELECTRONIC EAVESDROPPING. FULLY 80 PERCENT OF USEFUL INTEL IS SAID TO COME FROM INTERCEPTED CONVERSATIONS. BUT FIBER-OPTIC COMMO IS HARDER TO INTERCEPT THAN RADIO OR MICROWAVES. ENCRYPTION SOFTWARE COULD MAKE IT EASY AND CHEAP FOR ADVERSARIES TO CONCEAL MESSAGES. THE CIA [TRYS] TO DO TOO MUCH. IT MAINTAINS AGENTS IN WESTERN EUROPE~ FOR EXAMPLE~ WHO OFTEN REPLICATE THE WORK OF U.S. EMBASSIES. OFFICERS FOLLOW ECONOMIC TRENDS THAT COULD BE LEFT TO OTHERS. IT MAY NOT BE EASY TO GET THE AGENCY TO RELY ON JOURNALISTS OR ACADEMICS~ GIVEN ITS TRADITION OF HUMAN INTEL (HUMINT)~ SIGNALS INTEL (SIGINT)~ AND SATELLITE IMAGERY (IMINT). WHEN ONE OFFICIAL WANTED TO KNOW HOW WELL RUSSIAN-MADE SUBMARINES WERE PERFORMING IN IRAN~ HE RELIED ON ^ASKINT~^ HE SAYS. ^JUST ASK THEM.^ (CIABASE COMMENT - ONE OPEN SOURCE~ THE NEWSPAPER CHARDI KALA INTERNATIONAL~ THREE DAYS BEFORE THE TESTS WROTE: ^PREPARATIONS FOR AN INDIAN NUCLEAR TEST HAVE BEEN FURTHER CONFIRMED...WHO REPORT ALL KINDS OF FEVERISH NIGHTTIME ACTIVITY IN THE VICINITY OF POKHARAN IN RAJASTHAN STATE...^ <USNWR 6/1/98

DECISIONS BY NRO MADE BY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE - DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE~ CHAIRMAN; SCIENCE ADVISER TO PRESIDENT; AND DCI WHO IS IN CHARGE OF REQUIREMENTS. THIS GIVES HIM AUTHORITY TO CONTROL SATELLITES. ONCE NRO APPROVES A PROJECT~ IT CARRIED OUT BY CIA'S DDS&T OR BY AIR FORCE SPACE COMMAND. DAY-TO-DAY TASKING IMAGERY BY DCI THROUGH COMMITTEE ON IMAGERY REQUIREMENTS AND EXPLOITATION (COMIREX)~ HEADED BY CIA.

RECONNAISSANCE,NAVY'S COMPONENT OF NRO ACTIVITIES IS MANAGED BY THE SPACE AND NAVAL WARFARE SYSTEMS COMMAND (SPAWAR). COMMAND'S SPACE TECHNOLOGY DIRECTORATE (SPAWAR-40) AS DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IS ALSO CONDUCTED AT THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY. HISTORICALLY~ NAVY OPERATED (AS EXECUTIVE AGENT FOR NRO) A PROGRAM CALLED CLASSIC WIZARD~ SPACE SEGMENT OF WHICH IS VARIOUSLY TERMED NAVAL OCEAN SURVEILLANCE SATELLITE (NOSS) OR WHITE CLOUD. THIS CONSISTED OF A CONSTELLATION OF SATELLITES~ WHICH WERE LAUNCHED IN CLUSTERS OF ONE PRIMARY AND THREE SECONDARY SATELLITES. MOST RECENT LAUNCH OF THIS SYSTEM WAS ON AN ATLAS H FROM VANDENBERG ON 15 MAY 1987 (1987-043). ALSO DURING 60s-70s~ AIR FORCE~ (AGAIN AS EXECUTIVE AGENT FOR NRO) OPERATED A VARIETY OF LOW ALTITUDE BROAD AREA SURVEILLANCE SIGNALS INTEL SYSTEMS. THESE WERE LAUNCHED BOTH INDIVIDUALLY (COMMONLY KNOWN AS FERRET SATELLITES)~ OR AS SUB-SATELLITES THAT WERE LAUNCHED ALONG WITH KH-9 HEXAGON PHOTOGRAPHIC INTEL SATELLITES. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SUCH LAUNCHES FOR OVER A DECADE. GROUND SEGMENT FOR CLASSIC WIZARD WHITE CLOUD OCEAN SURVEILLANCE SATELLITE SYSTEM IS LOCATED AT FIVE WORLDWIDE NAVY SECURITY GROUP FACILITIES. ADAK NAVY SECURITY GROUP FACILITY~ ADAK ISLAND~ AK; BLOSSOM POINT~ BLOSSOM POINT~ MD. DIEGO GARCIA NAVY SECURITY GROUP FACILITY~ DIEGO GARCIA~ BRITISH INDIAN OCEAN TERRITORY (BIOT)~ UK; EDZELL NAVY SECURITY GROUP FACILITY~ AT RAF EDZELL~ SCOTLAND~ UK; WINTER HARBOR NAVY SECURITY GROUP FACILITY~ WINTER HARBOR~ ME; THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY'S MIDWAY RESEARCH CENTER (MRC)~ LOCATED IN QUANTICO~ VIRGINIA~ IS AN OPERATIONAL FACILITY NOMINALLY DEDICATED TO SPACE-RELATED APPLICATIONS IN NAVAL COMMUNICATIONS~ NAVIGATION~ AND BASIC RESEARCH. GIVEN NRL'S INVOLVEMENT IN DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF WIDE-AREA SURVEILLANCE SATELLITE PROGRAMS~ IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS FACILITY ALSO FUNCTIONS AS PART OF CLASSIC WIZARD GROUND NETWORK. WHITE CLOUD SYSTEM HAS BEEN REPLACED BY SATELLITES OF SPACE BASED WIDE AREA SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (SB-WASS). THIS NEW SYSTEM~ USED TO TRACK SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT ON A GLOBAL BASIS~ WOULD USE EITHER A RADAR (AIR FORCE PROPOSAL) OR AN INFRARED SENSOR (NAVY IDEA). CONCERNS ABOUT HIGH COST OF THIS SYSTEM~ AS WELL AS OTHER TECHNICAL AND OP UNCERTAINTIES~ LED TO POSTPONEMENT OF FULL-SCALE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACKNOWLEDGED SYSTEM TO 1995~ WITH A FIRST TEST FLIGHT ANTICIPATED AROUND 1999. CHARACTERISTICS OF SPACECRAFT LAUNCHED BY THE TITAN 2 AND TITAN 4 BOOSTERS~ BEGINNING IN 1989~ DEMONSTRATE EXISTENCE OF PARALLEL UN-ACKNOWLEDGED SB-WASS PROGRAM~ WHICH ACTUALLY FLEW SPACECRAFT RESEMBLING THOSE CONSIDERED IN THE ACKNOWLEDGED PROGRAM. THREE LAUNCHES OF THE TITAN 2 IN 1988~ 1989 AND 1992 PLACED SINGLE SPACECRAFT INTO ORBIT~ WITH THESE SPACECRAFT EXHIBITING REGULAR FLASHING REFLECTION PATTERNS~ AS WOULD BE EXPECTED FROM ROTATING REFLECTOR RADAR ANTENNA PLANNED FOR AIR FORCE SB-WASS.

THESE MEANS NOT DEFUNCT BUT COMPUTER OCCUPIES CENTRAL PLACE IN INTERPRETATION. AT A TERMINAL AN INTERPRETER MAY FACE TASK OF EXAMINING RECENT PHOTOS OR OLDER PHOTOS. USE OF COMPUTERS ALLOWS NOW FOR EASY RETRIEVAL. ONE COMPUTER OPTION IS MANIPULATION OF CONTRAST TO INCREASE VISIBILITY OF OBJECTS IN SHADOWS~ OBSCURED BY HAZE OR PHOTOGRAPHED WITH TOO LITTLE OR TOO MUCH LIGHT. ADAPTIVE FILTERING IS ONE MEANS OF MANIPULATION. COMPUTERS CAN BE USED TO DETECT OBJECTS. CHANGES IN A TARGET CAN BE DETERMINED BY COMPUTER~ USING TECHNIQUE KNOWN AS ELECTRONIC OPTICAL-SUBTRACTION.

RECONNAISSANCE,USSR. WHY WE BUILT THE SATELLITES. IN HIS ^CIA'S FLAWED SOVIET ESTIMATES^ [LETTERS~ MAY 13]~ WILLIAM LEE PROVIDES A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF DISTORTIONS THAT CHARACTERIZE HIS ATTACKS ON THE CIA [HE] PREPOSTEROUSLY] ESTIMATED THAT U.S. ^WASTED $5 BILLION TO $10 BILLION^ OR MORE ON RECONNAISSANCE SATELLITES TO SUPPORT ANALYSIS OF SOVIET DEFENSE SPENDING. THIS MUST HAVE BEEN STARTLING NEWS TO THOSE INVOLVED IN THE FUNDING OF SATELLITE PROGRAMS~ BECAUSE I FRANKLY DOUBT THAT MOST OF THEM WERE EVER MORE THAN VAGUELY AWARE OF CIA'S MILITARY COSTING EFFORT. AS DIRECTOR OF CIA'S OFFICE OF IMAGERY ANALYSIS IN LATE 1970S~ I READ AND HEARD MANY JUSTIFICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PROCUREMENT OF SATELLITE INTEL COLLECTION SYSTEMS. MOST FELL UNDER GENERAL RUBRIC OF ASSESSING THE SIZE~ CAPABILITIES AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS OF THE MILITARY FORCES THAT THREATENED SECURITY OF THE U.S. AND ITS ALLIES. THE CIA'S ANALYSIS OF SOVIET MILITARY EXPENDITURES WAS NEVER MENTIONED. WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE MILITARY COST ANALYSTS USED DATA ON SOVIET FORCES AND WEAPONS THE SATELLITES COLLECTED~ IT IS PERVERSE TWISTING OF THE FACTS TO CLAIM THAT THE SATELLITES WERE BUILT AND THE DATA COLLECTED BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A CIA COSTING MODEL. THE IDEA THAT ONE CENT LESS WOULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON SATELLITES IF THE CIA HAD NOT DONE ANY MILITARY COSTING ANALYSIS IS JUST PLAIN GOOFY. NOEL E.

PHOTOINTERPRETERS WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY FINDING STRATEGIC TARGETS IN THE VAST AMOUNT OF 70 MM FILM. SATELLITES WERE BUILT AROUND A PANORAMIC CAMERA THAT OPERATED NEAR DIFFRACTION LIMITS. WE ALL WORRIED A ABOUT THE VULNERABILITY OF CORONA. IT WAS AN EASY MATTER FOR THE SOVIETS TO LOCATE THESE SATELLITES AND PREDICT THEIR ORBITS... THE DESTRUCTION OF A LOW-ALTITUDE SATELLITE DOES NOT REQUIRE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. BECAUSE SUCH VEHICLES TRAVEL IN EARTH ORBIT AT SPEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY 17~000 MILES PER HOUR~ IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO STAND IN THEIR PATH TO DESTROY THEM... THESE PROPOSALS WERE NOT IMPLEMENTED~ PRIMARILY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRED A GREAT DEAL OF PAYLOAD WEIGHT. WE OPTED EACH TIME FOR INCREASED FILM LOADS AND PRAYED THAT CORONA WOULD NOT BE ATTACKED.

RICHARD ALLEN EXPLAINS HOW REAGAN WAS FIRST ALERTED TO THE USEFULNESS OF POPE PAUL'S POPULARITY TO US FOREIGN POLICY STRATEGIES. UNDER PRESIDENT CARTER~ THE CIA WAS ALREADY SUPPLYING STRIKING POLISH WORKERS WITH PHOTOCOPIERS~ VIDEO CAMERAS~ UNDERGROUND RADIO BROADCASTING EQUIPMENT AND EVEN DEVICES TO HELP THEM BREAK INTO OFFICIAL BROADCASTS. WHEN REAGAN TOOK OVER AS PRESIDENT~ THE PROCESS WAS IMMEDIATELY STEPPED UP. PER VERNON WALTERS~ PREVIOUS US PRESIDENTS WERE CONTENT TO CONTAIN THE USSR - UNLIKE REAGAN WHO DREAMED UP THE STAR WARS PROGRAMME TO EMBOIL MOSCOW IN A COSTLY COUNTER DEFENCE PLAN THAT WOULD DESTROY ITS ECONOMY. BUT THE PLAN WAS VULNERABLE TO CRITICISM ON GROUNDS OF COST AND FEAR OF A NEW ARMS RACE~ AND THE REAGAN ADM WAS ANXIOUS TO PREVENT ANY ATTACK FROM CHURCH LEADERS~ ESPECIALLY THE POPE~ WHO HAD CONDEMNED THE ARMS RACE EARLIER. THE PRESIDENT THEN SENT THE CIA CHIEF TO MAKE THE POPE STAR WARS-FRIENDLY. 'IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE~ BRIEFING THE POPE~' WALTERS SAYS. ' I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT IT HAD SOME SUCCESS. HE DID NOT CRITICIZE OUR DEFENCE PROGRAMMES AND THAT WAS ALL WE WANTED.' POPE PAUL ACTED TO WATER DOWN THE TEXT OF A DOCUMENT ON STAR WARS BY US BISHOPS~ AND TO CENSOR A HIGHLY DAMAGING REPORT BY THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. WHEN REAGAN DEMANDED THAT HE DISCIPLINE LIBERATION THEOLOGISTS - THE POPE COMPLIED~ VISITING NICARAGUA AND PUBLICLY HUMILIATING ERNESTO CARDINALE~ A PRIEST AND CABINET MINISTER. THESE STARTLING REVELATIONS BY THE BBC FILM CONFIRM THOSE MADE IN A BOOK PUBLISHED IN LATE 1996.

REVELATIONS~ IN A BBC DOCUMENTARY~ ARE MADE BY SUCH INSIDERS AS GENERAL VERNON WALTERS~ FORMER CIA DEPUTY DIRECTOR~ AND RICHARD ALLEN~ REAGAN'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER. WALTERS DESCRIBES HOW POPE JOHN PAUL II WAS ROPED IN AS A CIA AND WHITE HOUSE OPERATIVE~ WHILE ALLEN HAILS THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S LEADER AND THE [THE U.S.] AS THE GREATEST SECRET ALLIANCE OF MODERN TIMES. THE FILM~ RIVALS FOR PARADISE~ TRACES THE HISTORY OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE VATICAN AND THE KREMLIN FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA TO THE PRESENT DAY. IT ALSO DEALS WITH CERTAIN SHADY TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE VATICAN AND HITLER AND MUSSOLINI. OUR READERS WILL NOT FIND THE VATICAN'S POLITICAL AGENDA SURPRISING. [WE] HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH'S EFFORTS TO FIGHT ISLAM~ AND TO BACK UP WESTERN IMPERIAL STRATEGIES AND POLICIES IN MUSLIM COUNTRIES. THE CRUSADING VISITS TO SOUTHERN SUDAN BY BOTH THE POPE AND THE BRITISH ARCHBISHOP GEORGE CAREY~ WHICH SEEK TO SUPPORT THE U.S.'S DETERMINATION TO SECURE THE SECESSION OF SOUTH SUDAN TO FORM A BELT OF CHRISTIAN STATES ACROSS CENTRAL AFRICA~ IS A CASE IN POINT. THE FILM OPENS BY EXPOSING THAT SHORTLY AFTER THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION POPE BENEDICT XV SENT TWO ARCHBISHOPS TO NEGOTIATE SECRETLY WITH LENIN. THEN IT GOES ON TO DEAL AT LENGTH WITH THE VATICAN'S ANTI-COMMUNIST TREATIES WITH HITLER AND MUSSOLINI. THE THEN POPE PIUS XII FELT TOO COMPROMISED TO OBJECT WHEN HITLER INVADED POLAND.

THE OFFICIALS ASSUMED THE DOCUMENTS WERE IN ERROR BECAUSE OF A CODING PROBLEM THEY SAID THEY IDENTIFIED AND BECAUSE OTHER INDICATORS -- SUCH AS THE WEIGHT LISTED FOR THE MUNITIONS -- WERE INCONSISTENT WITH CBU-15 LOADS.
