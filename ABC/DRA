DRUGS,@47-97@ CIA'S ANGRY OVER DETAILS RE ITS INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG TRAFFICKING -- PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT KNOWS LITTLE. IT SELDOM REPORTS SUCH DETAILS; AND~ IT DOES NOT CATALOGUE ITS OWN SINS. CIA'S PR OFFICE GETS THEIR INFO FROM OPS DIRECTORATE AND THAT PROCESS/ELEMENT PRACTICES DECEIT EVEN WHEN IT KNOWS. POLICIES OF ^NEED TO KNOW^ AND ^COMPARTMENTATION~^ ADD TO THE DIFFICULTIES. TOP MANAGEMENT KNOWS SOME~ BUT INDIVIDUAL CASE OFFICERS FREQUENTLY ARE UNAWARE OF WHAT OTHERS IN THEIR OFFICES DO. RECORD-KEEPING IS INCOMPLETE. ONCE AN OPS PLAN BECOMES AN OP~ IT IS ASSIGNED A CRYPTONYM AND MOST ALL REPORTING GOES INTO OPS FILE WITH NO ATTEMPT MADE TO RECORD DETAILS IN AN INFO-RETRIEVAL SYSTEM. (EXCEPTIONS ARE SOME PERSONALITY DATA THAT GOES INTO AN INDIVIDUALS FILE~ AND INTEL REPORTING BEING CONSIDERED FOR DISSEMINATION.) ONCE AN OPS REPORT IS FILED~ INFO IS RECOVERABLE ONLY BY A DOCUMENT-BY-DOCUMENT REVIEW. CONSIDER THAT THE 1975-1976 CHURCH COMMITTEE SAID THAT IN A MULTI-YEAR PERIOD CIA RAN 900 MAJOR COVERT OPS AND THOUSANDS OF LESSER OPS. EACH OP GENERATES SOME TO MASSIVE DOCUMENTATION SO WE CAN APPRECIATE THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM. CIA'S IG PROMISED MONTHS AGO TO COMPILE A REPORT ON DRUG TRAFFICKING/SUPPRESSION. A THOROUGH JOB WOULD REVIEW ALL OPS FILES -- THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE SO HIS REPORT WILL ONLY TOUCH THE SURFACE. R. MCGEHEE 4/2/97

DRUGS,CENTRAL AMERICA~ @96@ MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO CIA CONNECTIONS TO A SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA DRUG RING THAT HELPED TOUCH OFF THE CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC OF THE 1980S. A MERCURY NEWS' THREE-PART SERIES ^DARK ALLIANCE~^ DETAILED HOW A DRUG RING SOLD TONS OF COCAINE TO THE STREET GANGS OF SOUTH-CENTRAL LOS ANGELES AND FUNNELED MILLIONS IN DRUG PROFITS TO A CIA-RUN GUERRILLA ARMY. SERIES TRACED THE CRACK COCAINE EXPLOSION TO TWO NICARAGUAN COCAINE DEALERS~ DANILO BLANDON AND NORWIN MENESES~ WHO WERE CIVILIAN LEADERS OF THE FRENTE DEMOCRATICA NICARAGUENSE (FDN)~ AN ANTI-COMMUNIST COMMANDO GROUP FORMED AND RUN BY THE CIA DURING THE 1980S. DANILO BLANDON~ A FORMER NICARAGUAN GVT OFFICIAL~ WAS CONDUIT FOR THOUSANDS OF KILOS OF COCAINE THAT FLOWED TO THE LOS ANGELES STREET GANGS BETWEEN 1982 AND 1986. BLANDON~ WHO PLEADED GUILTY TO COCAINE TRAFFICKING CHARGES IN 1992 AND WENT TO WORK FOR DEA AS AN INFORMANT~ RECENTLY TESTIFIED IN FEDERAL COURT THAT HE SOLD THE COCAINE IN THE CITY'S BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS AS A WAY TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE GUERRILLA ARMY. HIS BIGGEST CUSTOMER WAS A DRUG KINGPIN~ RICK ^FREEWAY^ ROSS~ WHO TURNED THE DRUGS INTO CRACK. ROSS IS NOW IN JAIL~ SET UP BY BLANDON IN A 1994 DRUG BUST.

SNIDER MUST DECIDE WHETHER TO RELEASE THE REPORT WITH MAJOR DELETIONS OR TO PREPARE AN UNCLASSIFIED SUMMARY. SNIDER'S NOMINATION IS NOW BEFORE THE SENATE. THE COVER-UP WAS AIDED BY THE MAJOR NEWS MEDIA -- WHICH DERIDED THE EVIDENCE AND PROTECTED THE CIA. THAT PATTERN CONTINUED THROUGH THE KERRY INVESTIGATION~ WHICH PUBLISHED A MAJOR REPORT IN APRIL 1989 DOCUMENTING NUMEROUS CONTRA DRUG TIES THROUGH PANAMA~ HONDURAS~ COSTA RICA AND THE MEDELLIN CARTEL. IN AUGUST 1996~ WHEN SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS REPORTER GARY WEBB WROTE A THREE-PART SERIES ABOUT THE ROLE OF CONTRA DRUG SHIPMENTS IN THE CRACK EPIDEMIC WHICH DEVASTATED SOUTH-CENTRAL LOS ANGELES~ THE MAJOR PAPERS RESPONDED AGAIN BY HEAPING RIDICULE ON WEBB. BUT WEBB'S REPORTING AND THE ANGER IT SPARKED IN BLACK COMMUNITIES PROMPTED A FULL REVIEW BY THE CIA'S IG AND THE IG AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE CIA'S REPORT WAS RELEASED IN JANUARY AND CONFIRMED THAT THE CIA HAD BLOCKED FEDERAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OF CONTRA-DRUG ACTIVITIES IN CALIFORNIA. VOLUME TWO -- A BROADER LOOK AT THE PROBLEM -- AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REPORT~ HOWEVER~ WERE CONSIDERED FAR MORE DAMAGING TO THE CIA. THE JUSTICE REPORT WAS WITHHELD BECAUSE OF REPORTED CONCERNS THAT IT MIGHT DISRUPT ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS LINKING CIA PERSONNEL TO THE CONTRA-DRUG SHIPMENTS. THE CIA'S VOLUME TWO ALSO REVEALED A LARGE DRUG NETWORK SURROUNDING THE CONTRA OPERATION AND DIRECT TIE-INS TO REAGAN ADM. RECENTLY~ SNIDER SERVED AS A CIA COUNSELOR UNDER DCI TENET. BEFORE THAT~ HE AND TENET WORKED TOGETHER IN THE SENATE INTEL COMMITTEE. SNIDER WAS THE STAFF AIDE FOR SEN. WILLIAM COHEN~ R-MAINE~ ON THE HOUSE-SENATE IRAN-CONTRA INVESTIGATION IN 1987.

THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO BLOCK OUR INVESTIGATION. IT MOVED PRISONERS TO MAKE THEM INACCESSIBLE~ INSTRUCTED JUSTICE EMPLOYEES NOT TO TALK TO US~ PUNISHED AN ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY FOR PASSING INFORMATION TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE. A REVIEW OF THE HISTORY OF COVERT OPERATIONS IN THE CARIBBEAN AND SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA SHOWS A 40-YEAR CONNECTION BETWEEN CRIME AND COVERT OPS THAT HAS REPEATEDLY BLOWN BACK ON THE UNITED STATES. SAME HISTORY WILL SHOW THAT THE OPS IN THE REGION WERE~ FOR THE MOST PART~ MORAL AND POLITICAL FAILURES. OTHER OPS IN ASIA AND EUROPE HAVE HAD SIMILAR CONSEQUENCES -- THE WORST IN THE NARCOTICS AREA.

CIA OFFICERS NOW EAGER TO REPORT ON ECONOMIC MATTERS ARE FREQUENTLY TRIPPING OVER STATE DEPART ECONOMIC EXPERTS.

ECONOMIC INTEL,PART I. JAPAN. LECTURE JETRO AND JAPANESE EXPERIENCE BY JOHN F. QUINN FOR FIFTH NATIONAL OPSEC CONFERENCE ^MANAGING RISK IN THE INFORMATION AGE^ 5/94. PAST FEW YEARS U.S. INTEL COMMUNITY (IC) DEBATING SHOULD CIA AND OTHER INTEL AGENCIES ASSIST AMERICAN CORPORATIONS BY COLLECTING ECONOMIC SECRETS FROM FOREIGN COMPETITORS? AS COLD WAR BEGAN TO WIND DOWN~ AMERICAN INTEL AGENCIES FOUND THEMSELVES FACING SOME ENTIRELY NEW CHALLENGES. TRADITIONAL COLD WAR OPPONENTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH AGGRESSIVE ECONOMIC COMPETITORS. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THESE SAME COMPETITORS ARE ALLIES AND TRADING PARTNERS OF THE UNITED STATES. SUBJECT HAS GENERATED OPPOSITION FROM OPPONENTS WITHIN U.S. IC AS WELL AS PRIVATE SECTOR. FORMER DCI GATES HAS STATED ^THE U.S. IC DOES NOT AND WILL NOT ENGAGE IN INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE.^ THERE A NUMBER OF WELL FOUNDED OBJECTIONS TO U.S. GVT INVOLVEMENT IN ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE. FOR EXAMPLE: WHAT KIND OF INFO DOES U.S. INDUSTRY NEED AND WHO DEFINES REQUIREMENTS? HOW SPECIFICALLY CAN GVT SPYING HELP PRIVATE INDUSTRY? TO WHOM SHOULD INFO BE GIVEN? HOW CAN COVERT INFO BE HANDED OUT WITHOUT DISCLOSING SENSITIVE INTEL SOURCES AND METHODS? IN AN AGE OF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS~ WHAT DEFINES AN ^AMERICAN^ CORPORATION? J. QUINN 5/74
ECONOMIC INTEL,PART II. JAPAN. FROM LECTURE BY J. QUINN. BY PROVIDING INTEL TO PRIVATE SECTOR~ U.S. COULD FIND ITSELF IN A POSITION OF DICTATING INDUSTRIAL POLICY. INTEL CANNOT PROTECT AMERICAN INDUSTRY FROM IT'S OWN DECISIONS. ^WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THIS INFO IF YOU HAD IT?^ U.S. BUSINESS HAS BEEN QUICK TO REJECT SUGGESTION. SOME OF OBJECTIONS VOICED BY PRIVATE SECTOR INCLUDE: GVT SPONSORED COMMERCIAL ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES COULD ALIENATE OUR ALLIES AND TRADING PARTNERS AND INTIMIDATE CUSTOMERS. FEW AMERICAN INDUSTRIES WOULD BE WILLING TO REVEAL THEIR STATUS ON SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES. ANALYSIS PROVIDED BY CIA HAS BEEN QUESTIONABLE. HOW CAN THIS POSSIBLY ASSIST U.S. BUSINESS? ^THE BEST INTEL SOURCE IS INDUSTRY ITSELF.^ ^..THE IDEA GVTT WOULD ENGAGE IN ESPIONAGE AGAINST FOREIGN COMPANIES TO IMPROVE AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS IS GROTESQUE. IN AN ERA OF FREE TRADE AND ECONOMIC INTERDEPENDENCE IT IS UNTHINKABLE.^ OBJECTIONS ARE VALID. HOWEVER~ EACH IS BASED ON ASSUMPTION THAT CLANDESTINE COLLECTION METHODS ARE NECESSARY TO PRODUCE EFFECTIVE COMMERCIAL INTEL. THIS MISSES ONE IMPORTANT POINT - THERE IS A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BUSINESS INTEL (BI) AND INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE. BUSINESS INTEL CAN BE DEFINED AS COLLECTION OF BUSINESS AND COMPETITIVE INFO THROUGH LEGAL AND ETHICAL METHODS. EIGHTY TO NINETY PERCENT OF INFO MAY BE OBTAINED THROUGH OPEN SOURCE COLLECTION METHODS. BUSINESS INTEL MIGHT BE COLLECTED THROUGH NEWSPAPER ARTICLES~ TRADE JOURNALS~ SECURITY AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) FILINGS~ SPECIALIZED DATABASES AND TRADE SHOW MATERIAL. INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE IS CLANDESTINE COLLECTION OF SENSITIVE INFO. THIS INFO BY ITS VERY NATURE IS NOT OPENLY ACCESSIBLE AND CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED THROUGH COVERT COLLECTION MEANS. INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE MIGHT INCLUDE THEFT OF SENSITIVE OR RESTRICTED COMPETITOR INFO COVERT RECRUITMENT OF SOURCES WITHIN A COMPETITORS FIRM~ AND OTHER SUCH METHODS. BUSINESS INTEL IS LEGAL. INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE IS NOT. MANY AMERICAN FIRMS IN FACT ALREADY MONITOR THEIR COMPETITORS. SOME COMPANIES LIKE MOTOROLA HAVE EFFECTIVE INTEL SYSTEMS. BUSINESS INTEL ONE OF HOTTEST TOPICS IN AMERICAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY. FOREIGN COMPETITORS FREQUENTLY ENJOY TACIT SUPPORT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS IN THEIR COLLECTION EFFORTS. JOHN QUINN LECTURE PART II 5/74
ECONOMIC INTEL,PART III. JAPAN. JAPANESE FIRMS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY GAINED LARGE SEGMENTS OF U.S. INDUSTRIES~ PARTICULARLY IN AUTOMOTIVE AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AREAS. COMPETITION HAS ALSO GENERATED SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN JAPANESE BUSINESS INTE METHODS. APART FROM SOME BASIC GENERALIZATIONS SUCH AS ^THE JAPANESE ARE VORACIOUS COLLECTORS OF INFO^ OR ^JAPANESE FIRMS EXCEL AT BUSINESS INTEL.^ JAPANESE INTEL ORGS MAY BE DIVIDED INTO GVT (GOJ) AND PRIVATE SECTOR. GOJ INTEL AGENCIES ARE NORMALLY QUITE SMALL IN SCALE. JAPAN DOES NOT HAVE A LARGE CENTRALIZED INTEL ORG. JAPAN'S INTEL NEEDS ARE ESSENTIALLY ECONOMIC IN NATURE AND MOST INTEL COLLECTION~ ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING IS HANDLED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THERE IS A INTERACTION BETWEEN GOJ AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. JAPANESE BUSINESS INTEL EFFORTS CONCENTRATE ON MARKET~ ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL INTEL. UNIQUE~ INNOVATIVE OR CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY RECEIVES PARTICULAR ATTENTION. THERE IS A MUCH STRONGER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOJ AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND GOJ MINISTRIES SUCH AS MINISTRY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE & INDUSTRY (MITI) AND IT'S TRADE PROMOTION AGENCY~ JAPAN EXTERNAL TRADE ORGANIZATION (JETRO). JETRO IS ALSO ONE OF BEST EXAMPLES OF A TRUE JAPANESE COMMERCIAL INTEL ORGANIZATION. TO COPE WITH POOR COLLECTION AFTER WWII~ A GROUP FROM OSAKA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND MAJOR JAPANESE BUSINESSES IN KANSAI AREA FORMED OVERSEAS TRADE PROMOTION ASSOCIATION (KAIGAI BOEKI SHINKOKAI). IN 1954 MITI TOOK OVER ORGANIZATION AND WITH GOJ SUPPORT EXPANDED ITS ACTIVITIES. UNDER LAW OF 1958~ NEW ORGANIZATION WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A SPECIAL CORPORATION. SINCE THAT TIME JETRO HAS FUNCTIONED AS A TRUE COMMERCIAL INTEL ORG~ ACTING AS AN EXTENDED ARM OF MITI TO PROMOTE EXTERNAL TRADE. JETRO HAS 84 DOMESTIC OFFICES COMPOSED OF 33 TRADE INFO CENTERS AND 51 ECONOMIC INTERNATIONALIZATION CENTERS IN JAPAN. JETRO HAS 48 OVERSEAS OFFICES AND OPERATES 28 SPECIALIZED JETRO CENTERS. JETRO HAS A STAFF OF ABOUT 1200 WHICH EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN JAPAN DOMESTIC (600 JAPANESE STAFF MEMBERS) AND OVERSEAS OFFICES (300 JAPANESE AND 300 LOCAL COUNTRY STAFF MEMBERS). JETRO ACTIVITIES INCLUDE RESEARCH OF ECONOMIC TRENDS~ DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION AND BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE. JETRO TARGETS INCLUDE ECONOMIC~ TRADE~ INDUSTRY~ TECHNOLOGY~ PRODUCTS~ MARKET TRENDS~ AREAS STUDIES~ ETC. JETRO PUBLISHES A WIDE VARIETY OF MATERIAL IN BOTH JAPANESE AND ENGLISH. EXAMPLES ARE TSUSHO KOHO AND THE JETRO DAILY. JOHN QUINN LECTURE 5/74

FBI,TERRORISM~ @98-99@ IN FBI SLANG THEY ARE KNOWN AS ^DIRTY TEAMS^ AND ^CLEAN TEAMS~^ OR AS ^DARK^ AND ^LIGHT^ AGENTS~ OR AS ^FIVES^ AND ^SIXES.^ THE TWO GROUPS ARE DEPLOYED TOGETHER WHEN TERRORISTS STRIKE OR WHEN TOP-SECRET INFO HAS GONE ASTRAY~ AND THEY OFTEN SPEND MONTHS~ EVEN YEARS~ WORKING IN TANDEM. YET THEY RARELY TALK TO EACH OTHER. AS FBI BECOMES MORE INVOLVED IN OVERSEAS INVESTIGATIONS OF TERRORIST THREATS~ USING TWO DISTINCT TEAMS OF AGENTS KEPT APART BY AN IMAGINARY WALL HAS BECOME A KEY TO SEPARATING CRIMINAL CASES THAT CAN BE PROSECUTED IN OPEN COURT FROM INTEL SECRETS THAT MUST BE PROTECTED FOREVER. ON ONE SIDE OF THE WALL ARE AGENTS PRIVY TO TOP-SECRET INTEL. ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE AGENTS PROTECTED FROM SUCH INFO SO THAT WHEN THEY ARE CHALLENGED IN COURT~ THEY NEED NOT FEAR REVEALING SECRETS OR INTRODUCING EVIDENCE TAINTED BY HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. FOLLOWING A PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE ISSUED LAST MAY~ FBI NOW WORKS WITH INTEL AGENCIES AND THE MILITARY IN FOREIGN COUNTERTERRORISM. WHEN A CASE CROSSES THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITY AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION~ THE FBI SETS UP ONE TEAM--THE DIRTY OR DARK TEAM--DRAWN FROM THE NATIONAL SECURITY DIVISION~ KNOWN AKA DIVISION FIVE TO HANDLE THE INTEL. ANOTHER TEAM--THE CLEAN OR LIGHT TEAM--OF FBI'S CRIMINAL DIVISION~ OR DIVISION SIX~ BUILDS THE CASE THAT WILL BE PRESENTED IN COURT. <WP 8/16/99 A13
