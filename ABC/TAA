SPREAD SPECTRUM BUGS ARE OF TWO TYPES: FREQUENCY HOPPING BUGS~ DIRECT SEQUENCE BUGS. DETECTING THESE BUGS IS BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF MOST COUNTERMEASURE EQUIPMENT. THE REMOTELY- POWERED RF BUGS REPRESENT AN INGENIOUS SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF TURNING A BUG OFF AND ON. THE EAVESDROPPER JUST STOPS TRANSMITTING THE RF SIGNAL WHICH POWERS THE BUG. THEREFORE~ WHEN A COUNTERMEASURE SWEEP IS BEING MADE~ THE BUG IS SIMPLY TURNED OFF AND CAN BE TURNED BACK ON AS SOON AS THE SWEEP TEAM LEAVES THE ROOM. AS AN EXOTIC THREAT~ THE LASER BEAM ON THE WINDOW REQUIRES ALMOST LABORATORY CONDITIONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY~ AND EVEN THEN ALL THE TARGET HAS TO DO IS DRAW HEAVY CURTAINS BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE WINDOW. HOWEVER~ OTHER MORE OPERATIONAL EXOTIC ^JAMES BOND^ STYLE BUGS DO EXIST AND USUALLY GO UNDETECTED BY SWEEP TEAMS.

SEOUL LAUNCHED A PROBE INTO A FOREIGN NEWS REPORT THAT SINCE 1991~ CANADA'S COMMUNICATION SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT (CSE) HAS GATHERED INTEL ON SOUTH KOREA'S ECONOMY~ DEFENSE AND SECURITY MAINLY THROUGH EAVESDROPPING ON COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN SOUTH KOREAN EMBASSY AND FOREIGN MINISTRY IN SEOUL. JANE SHORTEN~ WHO WORKED FOR CANADA'S CSE AS AN ANALYST FROM 1986-94~ SAID SHE SPIED ON KOREA. SHE SAID SHE ALSO SPIED ON OTHER FRIENDLY COUNTRIES SUCH AS MEXICO AND JAPAN. SHORTEN~ 38~ WAS INVOLVED IN A PROJECT CODE-NAMED AQUARIAN THAT BEGAN IN 1991 TO GATHER ECONOMIC~ DEFENSE AND SECURITY INTEL SOUTH KOREA. ^IT WAS BASICALLY COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN SOUTH KOREAN EMBASSY IN OTTAWA AND FOREIGN MINISTRY IN SEOUL ... ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN DIPLOMATIC (CORPS) WAS OF INTEREST.^ EAVESDROPPING INCLUDED SECRET DISCUSSIONS OF SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIALS DISCUSSING THE MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR PURCHASE OF CANADIAN NUCLEAR REACTORS. CSE IS PART OF THE DEFENSE DEPT BUT SHORTEN SAID SENIOR OFFICIALS AT THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT WERE AWARE OF ITS ACTIVITIES AND EAGER FOR THE INFO. REUTER 11/18/95

TECH~ AUDIO,U.S.~ NETHERLANDS~ @95@ A CRITICAL LOOK AT HIGH TECH SURVEILLANCE. LAST YEAR~ OFFICIAL AMERICAN JUSTICE STATISTICS HAD SHOWN A SERIOUS DROP IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WIRETAPS. A STUDY PUBLISHED IN LAST MONTH'S NEDERLANDSE JURISTENBLAD (DUTCH JUDICIAL REVIEW) BY DR. P. VAN KOPPEN ASSERTS THAT THE ^EFFECTIVENESS^ OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE~ INCLUDING FAX AND TELEPHONE INTERCEPTION~ AND THE USE OF DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONES IN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS IS ^VASTLY OVERRATED^ BY THE DUTCH POLICE. DR. VAN KOPPEN'S REPORT IS BASED ON 4~584 U.S. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT BETWEEN 1987 AND 1992 IN WHICH ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE WAS USED. IN THE SIX-YEAR PERIOD~ ALMOST 6.5 MILLION ^DIALOGS^ WERE MONITORED WHICH INVOLVED 435~000 PERSONS WHOSE CONVERSATIONS WERE INDIVIDUALLY TAPED AND ANALYZED. THE SIGINT ACTIVITY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF POLICE INVESTIGATIONS IN LESS THAN 25 PERCENT OF THE CASES~ MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVED DRUG-RELATED CRIME. INTEL ^TAKE^ WAS ADMISSIBLE IN COURT IN ONLY 5.5 PERCENT OF CASES. ESTIMATED COST TO U.S. TAXPAYER WAS $207 MILLION. FUNDING EXPENSIVE BUT RELATIVELY INEFFECTIVE SIGINT OPS IN SERIOUS CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS PLACES UNNECESSARY ^STRAIN^ ON GENERAL RESOURCES OF MANY POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND OFTEN DAMAGES WORKING RELATIONSHIP AND COOPERATION AMONG COLLEAGUES. <INT 3/13/95 42

AMERICA HAS GROWN MORE VULNERABLE TO TERRORISM AS ITS MILITARY DOMINANCE HAS INCREASED. TERRORISM IS THE ONE MEANS FOR THE WEAK TO STRIKE OUT AGAINST THE STRONG. TERRORISM NOW MEANS MASS CONVENTIONAL BOMBING~ AND EVEN MORE DESTRUCTIVE UNCONVENTIONAL ATTACKS WITH BIOLOGICAL~ CHEMICAL AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS. TODAY'S U.S. STRATEGY IS ABERRANT~ A PRODUCT OF THE COLD WAR. THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT AMERICANS WOULD BE TO STOP TURNING THEM INTO TARGETS.

A TRIAL FOLLOWED A STRING OF ARRESTS OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS IN 11 COUNTRIES.

BUT SKEPTICS ABOUND. YOSSEF BODANSKY~ STAFF DIRECTOR OF THE HOUSE TASK FORCE ON TERRORISM AND UNCONVENTIONAL WARFARE~ CREDITED RECENT U.S. SUCCESSES BUT SAID THEY WOULD HAVE LITTLE IMPACT IF THE U.S. REMAINS OBSESSED WITH BIN LADEN TO THE POINT THAT IT FORGETS ABOUT SUDAN~ IRAN AND PAKISTAN -- WHERE HE HAS HELP FINANCING AND DIRECTING HIS FOLLOWERS. THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST BIN LADEN IS COORDINATED BY RICHARD A. CLARKE AT NSC AND WAGED PRIMARILY BY CT CENTERS AT THE CIA AND FBI. THE TWO CENTERS HAVE INTERLOCKING MANAGEMENT~ TO ENCOURAGE A FLOW OF INFO BETWEEN FBI AND CIA. FBI LINKS ITS CENTER WITH 18 FBI-POLICE COUNTERTERRORISM TASK FORCES IN MAJOR U.S. CITIES AND 32 LEGAL LIAISON OFFICES WORLDWIDE~ NINE OF WHICH ARE NEW.

TERRORISM,@95-99@ WAR ON TERRORISM IS ON THE GROUND FLOOR OF CIA HQS. IN THE COUNTER TERRORISM CENTER (CTC)~ CIA AND FBI AGENTS TRACK MOVEMENTS OF [TERRORISTS]. FOR NEARLY FOUR YEARS~ ONE MAN HAS BEEN THE CONSUMING OBSESSION OF CTC AGENTS: OSAMA BIN LADEN. LONG BEFORE LAST AUGUST'S BOMBINGS IN KENYA AND TANZANIA~ THE TEAM ASSIGNED TO OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS ALREADY SHADOWING THE WEALTHY SAUDI EXILE SUSPECTED OF UNDERWRITING TERRORISTS WORLDWIDE - INTERCEPTING HIS CONVERSATIONS~ TRACING HIS FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND KEEPING TABS ON HIS ASSOCIATES AROUND THE GLOBE. LAST WEEK~ THE TEAM AT LAST BEGAN TO SEE RESULTS. FEDERAL PROSECUTORS CHARGED FOUR MEN LINKED TO BIN LADEN WITH CONSPIRACY TO KILL AMERICAN CITIZENS. ONE~ A U.S. CITIZEN NAMED WADIB AL HAGE~ WAS ARRESTED IN TEXAS. OTHERS WERE SNATCHED OUT OF HIDING IN PAKISTAN AND AFRICA AND HAULED BACK TO THE U.S. TO STAND TRIAL. THREE WERE ACCUSED OF MORE THAN 200 COUNTS OF MURDER. THESE ARE JUST A BEGINNING. CONGRESS HAS DEVOTED MORE THAN $1 BILLION TO BUILD A CRACK ANTITERRORIST CORPS. WITH COOPERATION FROM LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ABROAD~ MORE THAN 40 TERRORIST SUSPECTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE BEEN ROUNDED UP. SPY AGENCIES FIRST REALIZED THAT BIN LADEN WAS A THREAT AFTER THE 1993 WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING. INSIDE THE CTC~ AGENTS SET UP A SPECIAL BIN LADEN UNIT. THEY FOLLOWED THE MONEY. BUILDING ON CIA'S WORK~ FBI BEGAN MOVING IN ON THE SUSPECTS. FBI DISPATCHED MORE THAN 400 AGENTS AROUND THE WORLD TO TRACK DOWN THE BOMBERS. INTEL GAVE FBI AN EARLY BREAK: AGENTS PORING THROUGH INTERCEPTED COMMUNICATIONS HIT UPON AN INTRIGUING CONVERSATION. A GROUP OF KNOWN BIN LADEN ASSOCIATES IN AFRICA SAID THAT THEY THOUGHT ^SOMETHING BAD WAS GOING TO HAPPEN^ AND THAT THEY WERE ^GOING TO GET OUT OF THE AREA.^ U.S. AGENTS BELIEVED THE TERRORISTS WOULD TRAVEL THROUGH PAKISTAN ON THEIR WAY TO A BASE IN AFGHANISTAN. THEY ALERTED PAKISTANI AUTHORITIES TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS - AND MAY HAVE EVEN PROVIDED THE PAKISTANIS WITH THEIR FALSE NAMES AND PHYSICAL DESCRIPTIONS. PAKISTANI POLICE NABBED ONE OF THE MEN~ MOHAMMAD SADDIQ ODEB~ WHO WAS USING A POORLY FALSIFIED PASSPORT. GRILLED BY FBI AGENTS~ HE ADMITTED HE WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF AL QAEDA AND HE BELIEVED IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOMBINGS AND GAVE A SLEW OF NAMES. IT WAS THE CTC'S FIRST CONFIRMED LINK BETWEEN BIN LADEN AND BOMBINGS. FBI AGENTS BEGAN FEEDING INFO ABOUT BIN LADEN ENTRY AND EXIT VISAS~ AIR-LINE MANIFESTS AND TELEPHONE LOGS-INTO A COMPUTER DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY SUSPICIOUS PATTERNS. THEY DISCOVERED BIN LADEN WAS A SOPHISTICATED ENEMY. THE TERRORISTS WHO CARRIED OUT THE BOMBINGS WERE GIVEN A SPECIFIC TASK TO PERFORM~ BUT TOLD LITTLE ABOUT THE REST OF THE MISSION. THEY COULD LITERALLY PASS ONE ANOTHER ON THE STREET AND NOT KNOW THEY WERE PARTNERS IN CRIME. FEDS LEARNED THAT BIN LADEN'S MEN HAD BRAZENLY CASED OUT THE AMERICAN EMBASSIES BEFORE THE BOMBINGS. POSING AS U.S. INFORMANTS~ BIN LADEN SCOUTS ENTERED THE EMBASSIES WITH A PHONY WARNING: TERRORISTS WERE PLANNING TO BLOW UP THE BUILDING. THE MEN THEN WATCHED THE EMBASSY OVER THE FOLLOWING DAYS. TAKING NOTES ON THE SECURITY MEASURES PUT IN PLACE TO WARD OFF THE THREAT...SINCE THE CRUISE-MISSILE STRIKES~ THE BIN LADEN TEAM AT LANGLEY HAS FOCUSED ON CRIPPLING HIS OP.

TERRORISM,AFGHANISTAN~ KENYA~ @80-90@ THE USSR THREW ALMOST EVERY WEAPON IT HAD~ AT THE AFGHAN CAMPS ATTACKED BY THE U.S. LAST WEEK. THE SOVIETS ATTACKED THE CAMPS OUTSIDE THE TOWN OF KHOST WITH SCUD MISSILES~ 500-POUND BOMBS~ BARRAGES OF ARTILLERY~ FLIGHTS OF HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS AND THEIR CRACK SPECIAL FORCES. BUT NOTHING DROVE THE AFGHAN HOLY WARRIORS FROM THE MOUNTAINS. THE CAMPS~ HIDDEN IN THE STEEP MOUNTAINS AND MILE-DEEP VALLEYS OF PAKTIA PROVINCE~ WERE THE PLACE WHERE ALL SEVEN RANKING AFGHAN RESISTANCE LEADER HAD UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS. THE TERRITORY TARGETED LAST WEEK~ A SET OF SIX ENCAMPMENTS AROUND KHOST~ WHERE THE SAUDI EXILE OSAMA BIN LADEN HAS FINANCED A KIND OF ^TERRORIST UNIVERSITY~^ IS WELL KNOWN TO CIA. CIA'S MILITARY AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE AFGHAN REBELS HELPED BUILD THOSE CAMPS. AND SOME OF THE SAME WARRIORS WHO FOUGHT THE SOVIETS ARE NOW FIGHTING UNDER BIN LADEN'S BANNER. BIN LADEN SPENT THE 1980S BACKING THE MUJAHEDEEN FROM THEIR POLITICAL BASE IN PESHAWAR~ PAKISTAN. HE WAS ALLIED WITH THE MOST FUNDAMENTALIST LEADERS OF THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE~ PARTICULARLY GULBUDDIN HEKMATYAR~ HEAD OF THE GROUP CALLED THE ISLAMIC PARTY. AFTER THE FALL OF THE SOVIET-BACKED GOVT HEKMATYAR SPENT MOST OF HIS BRIEF TENURE AS PRIME MINISTER HURLING MISSILES AND MORTARS AT KABUL~ TRYING TO DISLODGE MORE MODERATE REBEL LEADERS FROM POWER. THE MORE MILITANT AFGHAN REBELS~ LIKE HEKMATYAR~ DENOUNCED THE U.S. AND BACKED IRAQ DURING THE PERSIAN GULF WAR IN 1991~ AS DID BIN LADEN. NO AMOUNT OF MONEY OR MORAL SUPPORT COULD KEEP THE VETERANS OF THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE FROM KILLING ONE ANOTHER AFTER THE FALL OF KABUL. THE CHAOS THAT THEIR INFIGHTING CREATED LED TO THE RISE OF THE TALIBAN~ THE MILITANT ARMED RELIGIOUS PARTY THAT NOW CONTROLS MOST OF AFGHANISTAN AND HARBORS BIN LADEN. SINCE THE SOVIET WITHDRAWAL~ AFGHAN RESISTANCE VETERANS HAVE HOARDED THE REMAINING WEAPONS SENT BY CIA AND SET UP MILITARY TRAINING CENTERS AT RESISTANCE CAMPS LIKE THE ONE NEAR KHOST. IN THOSE YEARS~ THOUSANDS OF ISLAMIC OUTCASTS~ RADICALS AND VISIONARIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD CAME TO AFGHANISTAN. BIN LADEN SPONSORED MANY OF THOSE FOREIGNERS.

WHEN HE BROUGHT 9~000 ARAB FIGHTERS INTO THAT WAR~ HE BECAME A NATIONAL HERO. SOME OF HIS CURRENT AFGHAN FELLOW FIGHTERS HAD BEEN TRAINED EARLIER BY THE CIA IN THE VERY CAMPS THAT WERE THE TARGET OF RECENT AMERICAN MISSILES. PER BIN LADEN IN 1996~ ^WHEN THE AMERICAN TROOPS ENTERED SAUDI ARABIA~ THE LAND OF THE TWO HOLY PLACES [MECCA AND MEDINA]~ THERE WAS A STRONG PROTEST FROM THE ULEMA [RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES]...^ THE [SAUDIS] HELPED YEMEN COMMUNISTS AGAINST THE SOUTHERN YEMENI MUSLIMS AND HELPED ARAFAT'S FIGHT AGAINST HAMAS. BIN LADEN HAD NO INVOLVEMENT IN THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING IN S.A. THE TWO BOMBINGS IN KENYA AND TANZANIA OCCURRED ON THE EIGHT ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARRIVAL OF U.S. TROOPS IN SAUDI ARABIA. BIN LADEN IS STILL OBSESSED WITH THE ISRAELI MASSACRE OF 107 LEBANESE REFUGEES AT QANA IN 4/96. BIN LADEN SAYS IT WAS AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.

TERRORISM,AFGHANISTAN~ PAKISTAN~ CHINA~ ALGERIA~ @80-98@ US-SAUDI-PAKISTANI ALLIANCE PLAYED THE CENTRAL ROLE IN THE AFGHAN MUJAHEDEEN'S EXPELLING THE USSR FROM AFGHANISTAN. THE MUJAHEDEEN~ SEIZED POWER IN APRIL 1992~ PAVING THE WAY FOR THE RISE OF THE TALIBAN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT TWO YEARS LATER. THE TALIBAN REGIME ALLOWED TRAINING CAMPS NEAR THE PAKISTANI BORDER ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED BY THE CIA AND PAKISTAN'S ISI TO GIVE GUERRILLA TRAINING TO FUNDAMENTALISTS FROM XINJIANG~ CHINA; BOSNIA; ALGERIA; AND ELSEWHERE. WHEN MOSCOW INTERVENED IN AFGHANISTAN IN 12/79~ THERE WERE SEVERAL SECULAR AND NATIONALIST AFGHAN GROUPS OPPOSED TO THE MOSCOW-BACKED COMMUNISTS. WASHINGTON HAD THE OPTION OF BOLSTERING THESE GROUPS AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO FORM AN ALLIANCE WITH THREE TRADITIONALIST ISLAMIC FACTIONS~ TWO OF THEM MONARCHIST. INSTEAD~ WASHINGTON BEEFED UP THE THREE FUNDAMENTALIST ORGS. THIS LEFT MODERATE ISLAMIC LEADERS NO CHOICE BUT TO ALLY WITH HARD-LINERS AND FORM THE RADICAL-DOMINATED ISLAMIC ALLIANCE OF AFGHAN MUJAHEDEEN (IAAM) IN 1983. MAIN ARCHITECT OF US POLICY WAS ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI. IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO EXPEL THE SOVIET TANKS~ HE REASONED. THIS WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPORT A COMPOSITE IDEOLOGY OF NATIONALISM AND ISLAM TO THE MUSLIM-MAJORITY CENTRAL ASIAN STATES AND SOVIET REPUBLICS. THE US-SAUDI-PAKISTANI ALLIANCE'S FINANCING~ TRAINING AND ARMING OF THE MUJAHEDEEN-RECRUITED FROM AMONG THE 3 MILLION AFGHAN REFUGEES IN PAKISTAN WAS COORDINATED BY THE CIA. THE MANAGEMENT RESTED WITH PAKISTAN'S ISI. ALL DONATIONS IN WEAPONS AND CASH BY VARIOUS SOURCES -- CHIEFLY THE U.S. AND RIYADH - WERE HANDLED BY THE CIA -- ABOUT $40 BILLION. BRZEZINSKI'S SUCCESSORS CONTINUED HIS INTENSIVE RADIO CAMPAIGN (THROUGH RADIO LIBERTY AND RADIO FREE EUROPE) TO AROUSE ISLAMIC CONSCIOUSNESS AND ETHNIC NATIONALISM IN CENTRAL ASIA.

FOR EXAMPLE~ IN THE ^DISCOTHEQUE^ BOMBING IN GERMANY [WHEREIN AMERICAN SERVICEMEN WERE KILLED] THAT WAS ALLEGEDLY THE PRETEXT FOR THE AMERICAN [RETALIATORY] BOMBINGS OF TRIPOLI AND BENGHAZI~ WHILE THE U.S. WAS SAYING THAT IT HAD CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT LIBYA WAS INVOLVED~ THE GERMAN GOV WAS OPENLY AND PUBLICLY SAYING THAT IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT LIBYA WAS INVOLVED. SO~ WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS THE MANUFACTURING OF EVIDENCE TO TRY TO JUSTIFY A MILITARY ATTACK AGAINST LIBYA. ALL OF A SUDDEN~ ALL OF THE BLAME WAS PUT ON LIBYA. FOR THE FIRST TWO-AND-HALF YEARS OF [FOLLOWING] THE PAN AM FLIGHT 103 LOCKERBIE BOMBING~ THE U.S WAS PUTTING THE BLAME ON A RENEGADE PALESTINIAN GROUP~ ON THE SYRIAN GOV AND ON THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT~ ARGUING THAT THEY HAD DONE THIS IN RETALIATION FOR THE SHOOTING DOWN OF THE IRANIAN AIRBUS BY THE USS VINCENNES. ALL OF A SUDDEN~ SOME MIRACULOUS NEW EVIDENCE GETS DISCOVERED OUT OF SENEGAL~ THAT NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD ABOUT BEFORE. IF YOU WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE PAGES OF THE EUROPEAN NEWSPAPERS -- THAT THE EXACT SAME WEEK THAT ALL THIS NEW EVIDENCE WAS MIRACULOUSLY DISCOVERED IN SENEGAL~ IMPLICATING LIBYA~ ALL OF SENEGAL'S DEBTS WERE RESCHEDULED BY THE PARIS CLUB~ AT A HIGHLY FAVORABLE [INTEREST] RATE -- WHICH LEADS ME TO CONCLUDE THAT~ THE SENEGALESE GOVERNMENT WAS BRIBED TO GO ALONG WITH THIS NEW MANUFACTURED EVIDENCE.

TERRORISM,MIDDLE EAST~ @97-98@ U.S. INTEL DREW UP PLANS LAST SPRING TO CAPTURE OSAMA BIN LADEN IN AFGHANISTAN. PLANNING BEGAN AFTER EVIDENCE LINKED HIM TO A SERIES OF ANTI-AMERICAN ATTACKS. THE CIA AND SPECIAL FORCES PLAN BEGAN MONTHS BEFORE THE AUGUST BOMBINGS OF TWO EMBASSIES~ AND CALLED FOR EXTRICATING HIM FROM AFGHANISTAN. PLAN WAS SHELVED DUE TO THE HIGH RISKS. BUT THE ADM SAID THEY WERE STILL DEVELOPING A BROAD RANGE OF OTHER OPTIONS AIMED HIM OR TO DISMANTLE HIS TERRORIST NETWORK WHEN BOMBS EXPLODED ON AUG. 7 AT THE EMBASSIES IN KENYA AND TANZANIA. THE ADM'S CRUISE MISSILE ATTACK WAS SWIFT RETALIATION. BIN LADEN~ AN ISLAMIC RADICAL~ WAS INITIALLY AN ALLY OF THE U.S. IN THE 1980'S~ AS A SUPPORTER OF THE CIA-BACKED AFGHAN REBELS BATTLING THE SOVIET OCCUPYING FORCES. HE CONTRIBUTED MILLIONS TO THE REBELS' AND HELPED RECRUIT AND SUPPORT THOUSANDS OF OTHER ARAB VOLUNTEERS. ^BACK THEN~ WE THOUGHT OF HIM AS THAT NICE SAUDI BUSINESSMAN~^ SAID A FORMER CIA OFFICIAL. AFTER THE SOVIET WITHDRAWAL~ BIN LADEN RETURNED TO SAUDI ARABIA AND SUPPORTED MILITANT ISLAMIC GROUPS THAT OPPOSED MODERATE ARAB REGIMES. HE TURNED AGAINST THE U.S. WITH THE PERSIAN GULF CRISIS AFTER IRAQ'S INVASION OF KUWAIT IN 1990. HE SAW THE PRESENCE OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN AND OTHER FOREIGN TROOPS ON SAUDI SOIL AS A DEEP RELIGIOUS AFFRONT. AFTER BEING FORCED OUT OF SAUDI ARABIA~ HE MOVED TO THE SUDAN~ WHERE HE INVESTED IN A WIDE ARRAY OF BUSINESSES AND BECAME A CLOSE ALLY OF HASSAN AL-TURABI~ LEADER OF THE SUDAN'S GOVERNING PARTY. HE CREATED A SERIES OF FRONT ORGS FOR NETWORKS OF TERRORISTS IN EGYPT~ ALGERIA~ YEMEN~ THE SUDAN~ LEBANON AND THE PHILIPPINES. HE AND HIS NETWORK ARE LINKED TO A WIDE ARRAY OF SUCCESSFUL TERRORIST ACTS AS WELL AS ABORTED PLOTS~ RANGING FROM PLANS TO KILL POPE JOHN PAUL II AND CLINTON DURING VISITS TO MANILA TO THE BOTCHED BOMBING IN DECEMBER 1992 OF A HOTEL IN YEMEN WHERE AMERICAN SOLDIERS BOUND FOR SOMALIA STAYED~ A 1995 ATTEMPT TO KILL PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK OF EGYPT AND A 1995 CAR BOMBING IN RIYADH~ SAUDI ARABIA~ THAT KILLED FIVE AMERICAN SOLDIERS. BY 1996~ HE EMERGED AS THE LEADING TARGET OF THE CIA'S COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER. HE WAS NAMED IN A SECRET PRESIDENTIAL COVERT ACTION ORDER THAT AUTHORIZED INTEL AGENCIES TO PLAN AND CARRY OUT COVERT OPS THAT MIGHT LEAD TO SOME DEATHS. BUT A ^LETHAL^ FINDING~ IS A RECOGNITION THAT THE ACTION CONTEMPLATED COULD LEAD TO SOME OF THOSE INVOLVED BEING KILLED.

HOOVER INSTITUTION SPONSORED THE CONFERENCE. U.S. AND WESTERN INTEL SERVICES REPUTEDLY HAVE AMASSED EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT BIN LADIN WORKED TO THIS END AS EARLY AS 1993. ^WE KNOW THAT BIN LADIN'S ORGANIZATION HAS ATTEMPTED TO DEVELOP POISONOUS GASES THAT COULD BE FIRED AT U.S. TROOPS IN THE GULF STATES~^ GANNON SAID~ INDICATING THAT BIN LADIN'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS ACTIVITIES WERE LINKED TO THE AL-SHIFA PHARMACEUTICAL PLANT IN KHARTOUM~ SUDAN~ WHICH THE U.S. BOMBED IN LATE AUGUST IN RETALIATION FOR THE BOMBINGS OF U.S. EMBASSIES IN KENYA AND TANZANIA. U.S. PROSECUTORS ASSERT THAT BIN LADIN AND MEMBERS OF HIS MILITANT ISLAMIC ORGANIZATION~ AL-QAIDA~ PLOTTED ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. TROOPS IN THE GULF.

TERRORISM,MIDDLE EAST~ @98@ THE U.S. HAS LONG WAGED A STRUGGLE AGAINST STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM. BUT IT HAS LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH THE BRAND OF STATELESS TERRORISM BIN LADEN REPRESENTS -- SOMEONE WHO MOVES INDEPENDENTLY~ IS IDEOLOGICAL AND IS MORE WILLING TO CREATE MASS CASUALTIES. WAGING A CAMPAIGN AGAINST SUCH REQUIRES A CONCERTED POLITICAL~ INTEL AND MILITARY CAMPAIGN. IT MEANS FINDING MEMBERS OF BIN LADEN'S ORG~ ARRESTING THOSE OR ATTACKING THEM MILITARILY~ WHILE STRANGLING THE ORG FINANCIALLY AND DIVIDING IT POLITICALLY. BIN LADEN'S AL QAI'DA~ THE LARGEST SUNNI MUSLIM TERRORIST ORG IN THE WORLD~ IS VAST AND COMPLEX. ITS LEADERS HEAD OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS~ AND SUPPORT MUSLIM FIGHTERS IN AFGHANISTAN~ BOSNIA~ CHECHNYA AND KOSOVO. THE NATION'S 13 SPY AGENCIES RELY HEAVILY ON SATELLITES~ WHICH ARE FINE FOR INTERCEPTING PHONE CONVERSATIONS OR SPOTTING TROOP MOVEMENTS BUT ILL-SUITED FOR PENETRATING OPAQUE ORGS LIKE BIN LADEN'S. IN 1995~ CIA BEGAN TO PUT MORE OFFICERS IN THE FIELD AND RECRUIT FOREIGN AGENTS. BUT EVEN THOSE EFFORTS MAY BE LACKING. ONLY A COUPLE OF DOZEN OFFICERS SPEAK ARABIC WELL AND FEWER SPEAK PASHTU OR DARI~ THE MAIN LANGUAGES IN AFGHANISTAN. THE U.S. MAY BE YEARS FROM PENETRATING TERRORIST ORGS WITH HUMAN SPIES. U.S. MUST PLAN A COMBINATION OF OVERT MILITARY ATTACKS~ A CAMPAIGN TO SEIZE BIN LADEN'S PERSONAL FINANCES~ AND A COVERT EFFORT TO DIVIDE HIS ORG AGAINST ITSELF.

THAILAND,THAILAND~ @66-68@ MCGEHEE'S SURVEY REPORTS PROVIDED A NEW PERSPECTIVE OF THE CPT. THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THAILAND FOCUSED ALL ITS EFFORTS RECRUITING AND MOTIVATING POOR FARMERS AND FORMING THEM INTO LIBERATION ASSOCIATIONS. LIBERATION ASSOCIATIONS WERE THE INITIAL AND LARGEST ORGANIZATIONAL ENTITY FROM WHICH ALL OTHER ENTITIES GREW. EARLIER CIA SAID THE CPT CONSISTED OF ONLY PARTY MEMBERS AND GUERRILLAS~ WITH A TOTAL OF 2~500 IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. OUR SURVEY SHOWED THERE WERE THAT MANY IN ONLY FOUR AMPHURS IN THIS ONE PROVINCE ALONE. THE AGENCY ALSO HAD REPORTED THE CPT HAD NO SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGES. AFTER A YEAR IN THE PROVINCE~ WE HAD CONFESSIONS FROM ABOUT 2~500 POOR FARMERS WHO HAD JOINED THE CPT AS LIBERATION ASSOCIATION MEMBERS AND WHO BELIEVED WHOLEHEARTEDLY IN THE CPT. DUE TO THE DETAILED INFO~ THE CPT IN THAT AREA COLLAPSED. BUT SUDDENLY CIA CANCELED THE PROGRAM AND ^FORGOT^ THE SURVEY INFORMATION. WHY? THE PROBLEM WAS VIETNAM -- CIA SOMEHOW OVER THE YEARS MISSED THE SEVEN-MILLION-PERSON-STRONG LIBERATION ASSOCIATION MEMBERS OF THE SVESE COMMUNISTS. THE THAI COMMUNISTS HAD RECEIVED TRAINING IN ORGANIZATIONAL PROCEDURES IN HUA BINH IN NORTH VIETNAM. IF THE TCP RECRUITED IN THE VILLAGES USING VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST ORGANIZATIONAL METHODOLOGY~ THEN SO HAD THE VIET CONG. IF THE VC WERE A POPULAR MOVEMENT~ THEN WE LOST ALL JUSTIFICATION FOR BEING IN VIETNAM. MCGEHEE LATER WAS SENT TO THAILAND FOR A SIX-MONTH TDY TO DRAW UP A LIST OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CPT. HE SEARCHED CIA FILES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY INCLUDING FILES OF SOME OF THE THAI SECURITY SERVICES.

AEI DEVELOPED PERHAPS THE MOST EFFECTIVE PUBLIC-RELATIONS CAMPAIGN FOR DISSEMINATING POLITICAL IDEAS THAT HAS EVER BEEN MOUNTED. MAJOR FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO AEI'S PHENOMENAL GROWTH WERE ESTABLISHMENT OF POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES AND A SHIFT IN FOCUS BY CONSERVATIVE FOUNDATIONS TO INFLUENCING DIRECTION OF POLITICS.
