GOODMAN. GOODMAN FROM 1966 TO 1986 WAS SENIOR SOVIET ANALYST AT CIA. IN 1991 HE WAS ONE OF THREE FORMER CIA OFFICIALS TO TESTIFY AGAINST THE CONFIRMATION OF ROBERT GATES AS DCI ON GROUNDS THAT GATES SLANTED INTEL TO SUIT POLICY. THE THREE REPORTS...INDICATE THAT THESE GROUPS WERE MORE INTERESTED IN ESTABLISHING ^NEW LEGITIMACY^ FOR CIA THAN IN TAKING A FRESH LOOK AT OUR INTEL NEEDS AND CORRECTING ABUSES OF PAST. CFR STUDY ARGUES THAT INTEL SHOULD BE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY POLICY. PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION GOES EVEN FURTHER~ AND ALL REPORTS ENDORSE COVERT ACTION. ^IN THE PAST~ U.S. POLICYMAKERS HAVE EXPLOITED NIES....THE PENTAGON PAPERS UNVEILED A LONG SERIES OF ESTIMATES THAT POINTED TO WHY U.S. STRATEGY WOULD FAIL IN VIETNAM.^ (CIABASE COMMENT: STORY THAT CIA INTEL WAS GOOD ON VIETNAM REFUSES TO DIE. CIA INTEL WAS HORRENDOUSLY INACCURATE AND DID NOT IN ANY SUBSTANTIVE WAY ESTIMATE THAT U.S. STRATEGY WOULD FAIL IN VIETNAM.) PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION WOULD INCREASE POLITICIZATION OF INTEL. REVIEW CONTAINS A SEGMENT ON FAILURES OF OVERSIGHT -- COMBEST~ CHAIRMAN OF HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IN ^IC21^ ARGUES THAT CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT SHOULD BE AN ADVOCATE RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT MECHANISM OF INTEL COMMUNITY.

WARNER (R-VA.)~ WHO SAID HE WANTED ^A COOLING OFF PERIOD^ OF CAREFUL STUDY TO FEND OFF ^SLASH AND BURN^ MEASURES ADVOCATED BY SOME OF HIS FELLOW LAWMAKERS AFTER REVELATION OF VARIOUS PROBLEMS.

COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT PATCHWORK OF 14 SEPARATE INTEL AGENCIES IS FUNCTIONING WELL. 17-MEMBER COMMISSION SAID ITS RECOMMENDATIONS WERE GUIDED BY THREE THEMES: A PERENNIAL NEED TO MAKE INTEL-GATHERING MORE RESPONSIVE TO POLICYMAKERS~ A NEED TO ENCOURAGE MORE COOPERATION BETWEEN AGENCIES~ AND A NEED TO INSTILL MORE ^MODERN MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.^ IT REPORTED THAT PERSONNEL REDUCTIONS BEGUN IN 1992 HAD ^FAR FROM SOLVED^ A SERIES OF INTEL COMMUNITY PROBLEMS BROUGHT ABOUT BY FACT THAT NUMBER OF CIVILIAN PERSONNEL GREW BY NEARLY 50 PERCENT IN COLD WAR DECADE FROM 1980 TO 1990. THE CIVILIAN WORK FORCE AT THE NSA~ CIA~ AND DIA WAS SHRUNK BY 12 PERCENT FROM 1990 TO 1996~ PAYROLLS AT THESE AGENCIES INCREASED BY 26 PERCENT. PAYROLL COSTS HAVE NOT ONLY CROWDED OUT INVESTMENT IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES~ BUT ALSO CONSTRAINED HIRING OF NEW EMPLOYEES NEEDED TO FACE NEW INTEL CHALLENGES. SOLUTION IS TO REDUCE CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS BY MORE THAN 10 PERCENT BELOW THOSE REDUCTIONS NOW MANDATED BY CONGRESS AND ALLOW FOR ONE-TIME PAYOUTS AND OTHER WAIVERS OF EMPLOYMENT RULES SO THAT LESS RELEVANT JOBS CAN BE LET GO. <WP 3/1/96 A15

THE CFR IS AT APEX OF CORPORATE~ ACADEMIC~ FOUNDATION~ GVT STRUCTURE AND JOHN DEUTCH~ DCI IS A MEMBER AS HAS BEEN MOST CIA DIRECTORS.

TENET WAS SUMMONED TO EXPLAIN WHY U.S. INTEL AGENCIES HAD FAILED TO PREDICT THAT INDIA WOULD CARRY OUT FIVE NUCLEAR BOMB TESTS THIS WEEK~ THE COUNTRY'S FIRST SINCE 1974. TENET SAID INDIA DECEIVED U.S. INTEL SATELLITES~ IN PART BECAUSE OF INFO IT RECEIVED IN DIPLOMATIC EXCHANGES WITH AMERICAN OFFICIALS AND IN NEWS STORIES ABOUT THE AMERICAN IMAGERY COLLECTION AND ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES. USING THAT DATA~ THEY APPARENTLY BURIED CABLES AND EQUIPMENT AT TIMES WHEN SATELLITES WERE NOT PASSING OVERHEAD. AS A DIVERSION~ THEY APPARENTLY HINTED ABOUT MISSILE TESTS AT ANOTHER SITE TO LEAD U.S. SATELLITE COVERAGE AWAY FROM THE NUCLEAR TESTING AREA. SEN.

IN SUCH CASES~ IT GETS RAW REPORTS THAT WERE RECEIVED BEFORE THE EVENT UNDER INQUIRY OCCURRED. PER SNIDER~ CONGRESS DOES NOT GET A COPY OF THE PRESIDENT'S DAILY BRIEF.

OVERSIGHT,CHINA~ @80-99@ A HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE CONCLUDES CHINA HAS STOLEN DESIGN SECRETS ON THE UNITED STATES' MOST ADVANCED THERMONUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE 700-PAGE DOCUMENT~ ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY A PANEL OF FIVE REPUBLICANS AND FOUR DEMOCRATS IS HEADED BY REP. COX. THE REPORT FINDS THAT A SECRET 1988 CHINESE DOCUMENT OBTAINED BY CIA IN 1995 THAT TRIGGERED THE LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY INVESTIGATION WAS PROVIDED BY A DOUBLE AGENT FOR CHINESE INTEL. THE COMMITTEE CITES A CIA CONCLUSION THAT NONETHELESS THE DOCUMENT CONTAINED CLASSIFIED U.S. THERMONUCLEAR WARHEAD DESIGN INFO AND OTHER TECHNICAL INFO ON U.S. NUCLEAR WEAPONS. CIA~ IN ITS OWN REVIEW OF CHINESE ESPIONAGE~ SAID IT WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH CHINA STOLE AND HOW MUCH IT GOT FROM OPEN SOURCES AND WHAT IMPACT IT HAD ON CHINESE WARHEAD DESIGN ADVANCES. THE COMMITTEE CONCLUDES THAT HUGHES ELECTRONICS AND LORAL SPACE & COMMUNICATIONS PASSED SENSITIVE TECHNICAL INFO TO CHINA AS PART OF A 1996 INVESTIGATION INTO THE FAILURE OF A CHINESE LONG MARCH ROCKET CARRYING A LORAL-BUILT COMMERCIAL SATELLITE WITHOUT AN EXPORT LICENSE~ EVEN THOUGH BOTH COMPANIES KNEW THEY NEEDED A LICENSE. <WP 5/25/99 A1

DOCUMENT IS THE BASIS FOR THE COMMITTEE'S BROAD CHARGE THAT THE CHINESE HAVE STOLEN INFO ABOUT ALL U.S. THERMONUCLEAR WEAPONS AND PARTICULARLY THE LATEST WARHEAD~ THE W-88. THE DOCUMENT~ DATED 1988~ WAS AMONG HUNDREDS OF POUNDS OF OTHER MATERIAL~ WRITTEN IN CHINESE~ THAT THE WALK-IN AGENT DELIVERED TO THE CIA IN A STILL-UNIDENTIFIED COUNTRY OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. BY THE END OF HIS DELIVERIES~ THE CIA WAS CONVINCED THAT THE WALK-IN WAS DIRECTED BY CHINESE INTEL~ THEREBY QUESTIONING THE RELIABILITY OF THE DELIVERED MATERIAL.

OVERSIGHT,CHINA~ @90-98@ CIA CONTACTS WITH HUGHES QUESTIONED. CIA OFFICIALS NOTIFIED A SENATE COMMITTEE THEY PLANNED TO CONTACT HUGHES ELECTRONICS ABOUT THE PANEL'S INVESTIGATION OF SATELLITE EXPORTS TO CHINA. THE PHONE CONTACT~ BASED ON WRITTEN GUIDANCE DRAFTED BY SEVERAL CIA OFFICIALS~ IS NOW AT THE CENTER OF A FEDERAL INQUIRY INTO WHETHER CIA OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE BY TIPPING OFF HUGHES TO QUESTIONS BEING ASKED BY SENATE INVESTIGATORS. HUGHES AND OTHER U.S. SATELLITE MAKERS ARE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL FEDERAL AND CONGRESSIONAL PROBES RE WHETHER CHINA WAS GIVEN RESTRICTED INFO THAT COULD BE USED TO IMPROVE ITS TECHNOLOGY. VALUABLE MILITARY TECHNOLOGY ALLEGEDLY FLOWED AS PART OF COMMERCIAL SATELLITE DEALS IN WHICH U.S.-BUILT COMMO SATELLITES WERE PUT INTO ORBIT ON LOW-COST CHINESE ROCKETS. AS A BUILDER OF SPY SATELLITES~ HUGHES HAS A LONG RELATIONSHIP WITH CIA~ AND CIA SAYS IT WAS ACTING AS MESSENGER BETWEEN THE SENATE PANEL AND HUGHES. THE INTEL COMMITTEE REGARDED CIA'S CONTACT WITH HUGHES THIS FALL AS A DELIBERATE. NOW~ HOWEVER~ U.S. OFFICIALS SAY CIA TOLD THE COMMITTEE THAT IT PLANNED CONTACT HUGHES. THE OFFICIALS SAY CIA IS BEWILDERED THAT AN ACTION THAT DREW NO SPECIAL NOTICE WHEN SIGNALED AHEAD OF TIME HAS ERUPTED INTO A FEDERAL CASE AFTER THE FACT. BUT THAT'S NOT HOW IT HAPPENED. CIA TOLD COMMITTEE STAFFERS THAT IT WAS PREPARING WRITTEN GUIDANCE FOR ALERTING HUGHES OFFICIALS BY PHONE ABOUT ASPECTS OF THE COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION. THE STAFFERS EXPRESSED STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT THE IDEA~ ONLY TO BE STUNNED DAYS LATER WHEN CIA TOLD THE COMMITTEE THAT THE CONTACT HAD BEEN MADE.

THERE ARE ETHICAL ISSUES INVOLVED IN THIS CASE. PEOPLE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GVT~ INCLUDING CONGRESS~ SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE JUDGMENTS THEY MADE.

THE CIA CLAIMS THAT IT WENT TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (RE HARBURY AND DEVINE CASES) AND SOUGHT GUIDANCE ABOUT THE PROSECUTION AND EXTRADITION OF COLONEL ALVAREZ WHEN IT LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THE DEATH OF AN AMERICAN. THEY APPARENTLY INFORMED THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY KNEW OF NO POLITICAL MOTIVATION FOR THE CRIME. NO MEMBER OF CONGRESS SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN VIOLATING A RULE OF THE INSTITUTION OR THEIR OATH OF OFFICE. THE LATTER IS CLEARLY THE HIGHER STANDARD. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS MUST COME TO FEEL~ THAT THEY HAVE AN EQUAL RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THE LAW TO FOLLOW THE LAWS OF THIS COUNTRY~ LIKE EVERY CITIZEN~ AND IT GOES TO THE VERY NATURE OF YOUR ROLE AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS. WE ARE AN OVERSIGHT INSTITUTION. PART OF OUR PURPOSE IS TO CONTROL GVT AGENCIES~ TO ENSURE THEY LIVE UNDER THE LAWS. ULTIMATELY~ WRITING TO THE PRESIDENT AND INFORMING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY BY A GOVERNMENT AGENCY~ THAT IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF OVERSIGHT. THERE ARE GOOD AND DECENT PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE CIA EVERY DAY. THEY LIVE WITHIN THE LAW. IT'S ADMIRAL STUDEMAN WHO FINDS EVERY EXCUSE FOR THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE LAW~ WHO DIDN'T FIND IT IN HIS OWN HEART TO TELL THE TRUTH TO AN AMERICAN FAMILY THAT WAS PAYING THE SALARIES OF HE AND HIS SENIOR OFFICERS. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO DO A DISSERVICE TO THE CIA. UNDER THE CURRENT RULES OF OPERATION~ BEING ON THE INTEL COMMITTEE IS ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBLE CONTRADICTION WITH MEMBERS OF THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE AND THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. I HAVE FOUND THIS THROUGHOUT MY YEARS IN CONGRESS. EVERY TIME I'D PARTICIPATE IN ANY BRIEFING WITH THE INTEL COMMUNITY~ IT MADE AN EFFECTIVE ROLE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.

THE PLAN~ IS ATTACHED TO THE STALLED CONFERENCE REPORT ON THE FISCAL 1998-99 STATE DEPARTMENT MEASURE. INCLUDED ARE: $20 MILLION IN HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THOSE AREAS IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN IRAQ WHERE THE BAGHDAD REGIME DOES NOT EXERCISE CONTROL.

THE DEMOCRATS WILL RESPOND BY REPEATING OLD~ SMEARS ABOUT BANKING TROUBLES IN JORDAN~ AS CHARLES ROBB DID AT MONDAY'S SENATE HEARING. ROBB'S QUESTION HAD THE EARMARKS OF A PLANT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE OR THE CIA. CHALABI'S RECENT TROUBLES STEM FROM HIS GOING PUBLIC IN LAST SUMMER REVEALING CIA'S BUNGLING IN IRAQ IN 1995 AND 1996. THE [CIA] STILL RESISTS INQUIRY INTO WHAT WENT WRONG IN IRAQ. THE SPIES AND GOVERNMENT EXPERTS OF THE BUSH AND CLINTON ERAS ARE BUSY TELLING YOU THAT SINCE THEY COULDN'T DO IT~ IT CAN'T BE DONE.

CIA WOULD BE THE IMPLEMENTER OF POLICY HERE~ WHICH IS A BIG DEPARTURE...^ SOS ALBRIGHT~ SAID CIA'S ROLE IN THE PEACE ACCORD WAS NO DIFFERENT THAN ITS TRADITIONAL WORK ON PREVIOUS SECURITY AGREEMENTS IN THE REGION.

[THIS] MIGHT LEAD TO ^THE POLITICIZATION OF INTEL...^ KENNETH POLLACK~ A SENIOR MIDDLE EAST ANALYST AT THE NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY~ SAID RISKS INVOLVED IN REACHING A DEAL MAKE IT IMPERATIVE FOR THE U.S. TO PUT ITS BEST ASSETS IN PLAY.

CONSULTANT AND MIDDLE EAST EXPERT WHO WAS VICE CHAIRMAN OF CIA'S NIC IN THE MID-1980S~ AGREED CIA'S OVERT INVOLVEMENT IN PEACE TALKS IS A DRAMATIC OUTGROWTH OF AGENCY'S LONG-STANDING LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN INTEL.
