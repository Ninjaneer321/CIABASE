STATE OF THE ART SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS~ CARRIER BATTLE GROUP~ MARINE AMPHIBIOUS FORCE~ HIGHLY TRAINED SPECIAL FORCES~ ELITE RANGE AND AIRBORNE TROOPS AND LATEST HELICOPTERS AND SMALL ARMS. THESE WERE DEPLOYED IN OVERWHELMING FORCE. THEY ACTUALLY MET A FORCE OF SOME 748 CUBANS OF WHOM ONLY 50 WERE TRAINED~ AND AROUND 2~000 GRENADIAN TROOPS. FIGHTING WAS DONE ALMOST ENTIRELY BY GRENADIAN PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY AND EVEN THEY HAD BEEN TOLD TO LAY DOWN ARMS AND DON CIVILIAN CLOTHES. <SA 244
INTEL F,GRENADA~ @83@ THE RESULT OF INADEQUATE INTEL WAS THAT THE INVADING FORCE HAD NO CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT EXACTLY THEY MIGHT BE FACING.

THE STRENGTH OF THE CUBANS WAS REVISED UPWARDS TO 700 JUST BEFORE THE INVASION AND THEN DURING THE COURSE OF THE FIRST DAY WAS REVISED ONCE AGAIN TO 5~000~ A FIGURE OUT OF PROPORTION TO REALITY.

DCI TENET CONSTITUTED A PANEL LED BY RETIRED ADMIRAL JEREMIAH TO INVESTIGATE THE LAPSE. HIS REPORT SAID THE INTEL AGENCIES HAD TO FIND WAYS TO ISSUE WARNINGS BY MAKING SURE THAT CONTRARIAN VIEWS WERE HEARD. SO~ THE CHAIRMAN OF THE INTER-AGENCY NATIONAL INTEL COUNCIL~ MR.

SENIOR OFFICIALS SAY THEY WOULD GUARD AGAINST THE NEW TEAMS BEING TINGED WITH PARTISANSHIP AND THAT THEY WOULD BE USED ONLY ON A SELECT BASIS. BUT ONE VIEW IS THAT THE OUTSIDE EXPERT PANELS ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE FULL TIME IN-HOUSE WARNING OFFICER POST IN THE CIA WHICH WAS CREATED IN 1979 AS A PART OF CONGRESSIONAL DEMANDS FOR REFORMS. VICKERS~ HAD BEEN IN THE POST SINCE 1996. IN FEBRUARY~ VICKERS POLLED ALL ANALYSTS ON WHETHER THE BJP~ IF VOTED TO POWER~ WOULD TURN INDIA INTO A NUCLEAR POWER.

U.S. OFFICIALS SAID RECENT SATELLITE PICTURES SHOWED NO SIGNS OF UNUSUAL ACTIVITY AT INDIA'S TEST RANGE. AS A RESULT~ NONE OF THE IMAGERY ANALYSTS RESPONSIBLE FOR INDIA WERE ON ALERT WHEN THE FIRST CLEAR INDICATIONS OF IMPENDING TESTS EMERGED. SOME NUCLEAR EXPERTS CREDIT INDIA WITH KNOWING WHEN TO HIDE FROM U.S. SPY SATELLITES. R.R. SUBRAMANIAN~ A NUCLEAR PHYSICIST WITH NEW DELHI'S INDEPENDENT INSTITUTE FOR DEFENSE STUDIES AND ANALYSES~ SAID HIDING PREPARATIONS FOR THE TESTS WAS MERELY A MATTER OF CHOOSING THE HOURS WHEN THE SATELLITES WERE LOOKING ELSEWHERE TO MOVE THE NECESSARY PEOPLE AND CHEMICALS. DCI TENET TOLD LAWMAKERS THAT INDIA CHOSE A PERIOD OF FREQUENT SANDSTORMS AS THE TIME TO CONDUCT UNDERGROUND BLASTS. THOSE SAND CLOUDS WOULD EFFECTIVELY BLIND THE TWO KH-11 ^KEYHOLE^ PHOTO-IMAGERY SPY SATELLITES. BUT OTHERS SAY IT WAS A QUESTION OF MISSING OBVIOUS CLUES.

THE US HAD NO ADVANCE INDICATION THAT THE TESTS WOULD TAKE PLACE~ AND AS OF MONDAY PM BERGER DID NOT EVEN HAVE CONFIRMATION THAT TESTS HAD TAKEN PLACE. ALL OF WHICH CONFIRMS THE PROPOSITION THAT THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION OF THE US INTEL COMMUNITY TO COVER COUNTER-PROLIFERATION ISSUES IS BROKEN AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

INTEL F,INDIA~ @98@ ONE WEEK BEFORE THE INDIAN NUCLEAR TEST DCI TENET TOLD HIS EMPLOYEES HE BELIEVED IT'S ESPIONAGE HAD ERODED AND ITS ANALYSTS WERE DEPENDING TOO MUCH ON PENTAGON SPY SATELLITES. HE SAID CIA'S HUMAN SOURCES WERE ^SPREAD TOO THIN^ AND ADVERSARIES WERE DEVELOPING TECHNIQUES TO UNDERMINE TECHNICAL COLLECTION. HE LAID OUT HIS FIVE- TO 10-YEAR PLAN FOR U.S. INTEL. RECRUITMENT OF OPS OFFICERS SLOWED IN THE EARLY 1990S AND THAT MORE EXPERIENCED CASE OFFICERS WHO HAD COME IN DURING THE HIRING BULGE OF THE 1970S AND EARLY 1980S WERE (RETIRING). HUMAN INTEL EMPHASIS WOULD BE A ^SUSTAINED COMMITMENT^ TO RECRUITMENT~ TRAINING AND RETENTION OF PERSONNEL FOR HARD TARGETS. HE WOULD PROPOSE A CLANDESTINE RESERVE OF FORMER OPS OFFICERS. CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC~ FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE YEARS~ MONEY AND RISK OF FAILURE INVOLVED IN SENDING PERSONNEL ABROAD~ ESTABLISHING THEM IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY WORK IN OVERT JOBS WHILE SUPERVISING FOREIGN AGENTS. SUCH NOCS (NONOFFICIAL COVER OFFICERS) ARE MORE EXPENSIVE TO SUPPORT AND KEEP THAN CIA OFFICERS WHO WORK UNDER DIPLOMATIC COVER. FIXING HUMAN INTEL PROBLEMS~ WILL TAKE ^FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS~ AT LEAST.^ CIA ESPIONAGE~ PENTAGON TECHNICAL COLLECTION AND STATE DEPARTMENT DIPLOMATIC REPORTING FEED INTO WHAT IS CALLED ALL-SOURCE ANALYSIS. IN THE CASE OF INDIA~ DIPLOMATIC REPORTING INDICATING THAT NO TESTS WERE PLANNED HAD THE EFFECT OF KEEPING TECHNICAL COLLECTION AT A STEADY LEVEL.

DIA EXPERTS NOTED THAT THERE WAS A SERIES OF SERIOUS INDICATORS SHOWING THAT AN INVASION WAS NOT BEING PREPARED: IT AN ^ARMY-ONLY OP^ WITHOUT COORDINATION WITH AVIATION; ^NO DEFENSIVE MEASURES^ WERE PUT IN PLACE; IRAN~ WHICH HAS GOOD INTEL ON IRAQI INTENTIONS~ NEVER PUT IT FORCES ON HIGHER MILITARY ALERT STATUS; IRAQ DIDN'T MOVE TO DISPERSE ITS AIRCRAFT TO PROTECT THEM FROM ATTACK. VERY PROBABLY CIA BECAME ALARMED AND ORDERED ALL AVAILABLE AIRCRAFT TO CARRY OUT SURVEILLANCE AGAINST DIVISIONS. IF INDEED IT IS CIA THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISION~ CIA WILL CARRY BLAME FOR MISINTERPRETING INTELLIGENCE AND UNLEASHING A MAJOR~ UNJUSTIFIED MILITARY DEPLOYMENT THAT VERGED ON WAR. BECAUSE OF THE INTENSE OVERHEAD ACTIVITY~ REPUBLICAN GUARD DIVISIONS DISPERSED FROM THEIR GARRISONS NEAR SHAIBAH AND SIMPLY SPREAD OUT OF OFFER LESS OF A TARGET TO WHAT THEY WERE SURE WERE FORTHCOMING AIR STRIKES.

THIS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR ALL INTEL OPS AIMED AT RADICAL ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST TERRORISTS IN MIDDLE EAST AND AROUND GLOBE. MANY RADICALS WERE ACTIVATED BY CIA'S OP IN AFGHANISTAN DURING 1980S THAT BROUGHT FUNDAMENTALISTS FROM AROUND MIDDLE EAST AND TRAINED~ ARMED AND ENERGIZED THEIR TERRORISM. THERE IS AN IRONY IN ALL OF THIS -- CIA CREATES THREAT THAT IS NOW PRIMARY REASON FOR ITS EXISTENCE.

INTEL F,SUDAN~ @98-99@ ONE MONTH BEFORE THE U.S. BOMBED THE EL SHIFA PLANT IN SUDAN~ CIA ANALYSTS SAID MORE TESTING WOULD BE NEEDED. THE BOMBING~ LED TO A LAWSUIT BY THE PLANT'S OWNER~ AND RETRACTIONS. THE ADM CONCEDES THE PLANT DID MAKE SOME MEDICINES AND IT MAY NOT HAVE MADE CHEMICAL WEAPONS. CIA ANALYSTS CONSIDERED EMPTA TO BE A VIRTUALLY SURE-FIRE INDICATOR THAT THE PLANT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS. ANALYSTS~ RECOMMENDED [GETTING] MORE SOIL SAMPLES. EVEN IF EL SHIFA DID MAKE NERVE GAS~ THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF EMPTA WAS PRESENT IN THE SOIL OUTSIDE THE PLANT. [BUT] DCI TENET DID NOT MENTION ANY NEED FOR FURTHER TESTING WHEN HE PRESENTED SENIOR POLICYMAKERS WITH A ^MOSAIC^ OF INTEL TO SUPPORT THE TARGETING OF EL SHIFA AT A WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING ON 8/17/98~ THREE DAYS BEFORE THE U.S. MISSILE STRIKE. TENET'S CHAIN OF EVIDENCE~ CONSISTED OF: FINANCIAL RECORDS ENABLING CIA ANALYSTS TO ^FOLLOW THE MOVEMENT^ OF MILLIONS FROM BIN LADEN TO SUDAN'S STATE-OWNED MILITARY INDUSTRIAL CORP. IN THE MID-1990S. ^HIGHLY RELIABLE INTELLIGENCE^ INDICATING BIN LADEN HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH SUDAN~ ENABLING HIM TO PRODUCE CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SUDAN WITH GOVT ASSISTANCE. FREQUENT VISITS BY OFFICIALS LINKED TO EL SHIFA'S ORIGINAL OWNER TO SAMARA DRUG INDUSTRIES IN IRAQ~ A FIRM CLOSELY LINKED TO THE HEAD OF IRAQ'S PROGRAM FOR PRODUCING VX FROM EMPTA. AND~ FINALLY~ THE SOIL SAMPLE WITH A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF EMPTA GATHERED NEAR THE EL SHIFA PLANT BY A CIA AGENT WHO WAS POLYGRAPHED. <WP 8/21/99 A01
INTEL F,SUDAN~ @98@ [IN STRIKING BACK AT TERRORISM] YOU DON'T WANT TO GET YOUR FACTS WRONG. THAT IS WHY AN INTEL FAILURE IN THE CHOICE OF TARGETS IN SUDAN IS SO AWFUL TO CONTEMPLATE. WE DO NOT KNOW THAT CHEMICAL WEAPONS OR THEIR PRECURSORS WERE NOT BEING PRODUCED AT THE SUDAN FACTORY. BUT ENOUGH QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED~ AND THE ADM'S STORY HAS BEEN OFTEN ENOUGH REVISED~ TO WARRANT INQUIRY. AT FIRST~ THE ADM ALLEGED A CLOSE FINANCIAL LINK BETWEEN OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE SUDAN FACTORY. NOW IT SEEMS FAR LESS SURE. THE FACTORY WAS LIGHTLY GUARDED~ VISITED BY ENGINEERS FROM MANY COUNTRIES~ AND WELL-KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC. THE ADM DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE FACTORY PRODUCED MEDICINES. BUT NO ONE NOW DISPUTES THAT THE PLANT WAS MAKING ANTI-MALARIA DRUGS AND OTHER VALUABLE AND INNOCUOUS PHARMACEUTICALS. THE U.S. DECISION SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BASED ON A SINGLE SOIL SAMPLE~ FROM OUTSIDE THE FACTORY~ THAT CONTAINED MORE THAN A TRACE OF A PRECURSOR OF THE DEADLY VX AGENT.

COMMITTEE RECEIVED TESTIMONY THAT PROBLEMS WITH INTEL IN VIETNAM WERE NOT CONFINED TO TET. UP TO THE LAST DAYS OF SOUTH VIETNAMESE EXISTENCE~ CERTAIN BLINDERS PREVENTED OBJECTIVE REPORTING FROM THE FIELD AND AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF THE FIELD SITUATION BY WASHINGTON.

INTEL F,YUGOSLAVIA~ @98-99@ DCI TENET~ PREDICTED IN CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY IN FEBRUARY THAT THERE WOULD BE A MAJOR SPRING OFFENSIVE BY THE SERBS IN KOSOVO AND HUGE REFUGEE FLOWS. BUT INTEL ASSESSMENTS PRESENTED TO CLINTON ABOUT HOW MILOSEVIC WOULD RESPOND TO NATO THREATS OF MILITARY FORCE WERE VAGUE. REPORTS INCLUDED SPECULATION THAT THE YUGOSLAV LEADER WOULD BACK DOWN IN THE FACE OF AIR STRIKES. ONE INTERAGENCY INTEL REPORT OF JANUARY 1999~ FOR EXAMPLE~ CONCLUDED THAT ^MILOSEVIC DOESN'T WANT A WAR HE CAN'T WIN.^ ^AFTER ENOUGH OF A DEFENSE TO SUSTAIN HIS HONOR AND ASSUAGE HIS BACKERS HE WILL QUICKLY SUE FOR PEACE.^ PRODDED BY SUCH ASSESSMENTS AND HIS ADVISERS~ CLINTON PRESSED AHEAD WITH THREATS COUPLED WITH NEGOTIATIONS~ GAMBLING THAT MILOSEVIC WOULD BACK DOWN. THESE THREATS QUICKLY BECAME A TEST OF NATO'S CREDIBILITY~ WITH THE ADDED ONUS OF THE ALLIANCE'S LOOMING 50TH ANNIVERSARY. FROM THE MOMENT YUGOSLAVIA FELL APART IN 1991~ KOSOVO -- WITH ITS 90 PERCENT ETHNIC ALBANIAN POPULATION~ AND A SERBIAN MINORITY THAT HELD ITS LAND SACRED -- WAS VIEWED AS A PLACE FROM WHICH A WIDER WAR COULD ERUPT. THE BUSH ADM~ WHICH ADOPTED A HANDS-OFF POLICY ON THE KILLINGS IN CROATIA AND BOSNIA~ WARNED MILOSEVIC ON 12/29/92~ THAT THE U.S. WAS PREPARED TO TAKE UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION IF THE SERBS SPARKED A CONFLICT IN KOSOVO. THE KILLING IN KOSOVO BEGAN IN EARNEST IN 2/98~ WHEN THE SERBS RETALIATED FOR REBEL ATTACKS ON POLICEMEN WITH BRUTAL OP OF THEIR OWN IN THE DRENICA AREA.

INTEL F,YUGOSLAVIA~ CHINA~ @99@ IN MISTAKENLY TARGETING THE CHINESE EMBASSY IN BELGRADE~ U.S. INTEL WORKED FROM AN OUTDATED MAP ISSUED BEFORE CHINA BUILT ITS DIPLOMATIC COMPOUND SEVERAL YEARS AGO. IT WAS THE CIA~ THAT MISIDENTIFIED THE SITE. THE B-2 BOMBER ATTACK~ DROPPED SEVERAL SATELLITE-GUIDED BOMBS ON THE EMBASSY~ KILLING FOUR PEOPLE AND INJURING 20 OTHERS. OFFICIALS SAID THE BOMBS HIT EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE PROGRAMMED TO GO~ BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE WRONG. CIA HAD BEEN GATHERING INFO ABOUT THE YUGOSLAV SUPPLY AND PROCUREMENT DIRECTORATE FOR YEARS~ FOCUSING ON ARMS DEALS. THE EMBASSY WAS OPENED IN THAT LOCATION THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO. THE MAP USED BY THE CIA WAS PREPARED BY THE PENTAGON'S NATIONAL IMAGERY AND MAPPING AGENCY WHEN CHINA'S EMBASSY WAS IN DOWNTOWN BELGRADE~ MILES FROM ITS CURRENT SITE. ANY RECENT TOURIST MAP SHOWS THE CHINESE EMBASSY AT ITS CURRENT LOCATION. A NUMBER OF U.S. DIPLOMATS HAD ATTENDED SOCIAL FUNCTIONS AT THE NEW CHINESE EMBASSY IN RECENT YEARS~ INCLUDING THE DEFENSE ATTACHE~ WHOSE JOB IT IS TO PROVIDE DIA WITH UP-TO-DATE MAPS OF THE CITY.

HE BLAMED ``A WHOLE SERIES OF OMISSIONS.'' ``OVER THE LAST 13 YEARS~ WE HAVE GUTTED OUR INTEL AND MILITARY CAPABILITIES~ AND NOW THE CHICKENS HAVE COME HOME TO ROOST~'' SAID SEN. RICHARD SHELBY~ CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE INTEL COMMITTEE. FOR THE CIA~ THE ADMISSION THAT IT USED OUT-OF-DATE MAPS THAT SHOWED THE CHINESE EMBASSY IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION~ AND THAT IT USED EDUCATED GUESSES IN PINPOINTING A PURPORTED MILITARY TARGET THAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE EMBASSY~ COULD YIELD A SIMILAR BUDGET INCREASE. THE ADM SEEKS ABOUT $29 BILLION FOR INTEL PROGRAMS IN THE 2000 BUDGET~ AN INCREASE OF ABOUT 9 PERCENT. JUST TWO WEEKS AGO~ THE HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE PASSED ITS VERSION OF THE BUDGET~ ADDING LESS THAN 1 PERCENT TO CLINTON'S REQUEST. AT THAT TIME~ REP.

THEY USED TO MONITOR ARMS-CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND GUARD AGAINST PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR~ CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS.

IMAGERY~ COMMO INTERCEPTS AND ALL MANNER OF INTEL MOVE IN SECONDS ACROSS AN IC INTRANET CALLED INTELINK~ A TOP-SECRET~ SUPER-SECURE NETWORK THAT HAS REVOLUTIONIZED THE DISSEMINATION OF U.S. INTEL AND BECOME A POTENT~ SEARCHABLE ANALYTIC TOOL FOR ANALYSTS AND MILITARY OFFICERS ALL OVER THE WORLD. FREDRICK THOMAS MARTIN~ A FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY OFFICIAL~ TELLS HOW ALL THIS HAPPENED IN A NEW BOOK CALLED -- TOP SECRET INTRANET -- DESCRIBING A JOURNEY THROUGH CYBERSPACE IN WHICH THE 13 U.S. INTEL AGENCIES HAVE GONE FROM ZEALOUSLY GUARDING THEIR OWN SECRETS TO SHARING MANY OF THEM OVER WHAT IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST~ MOST SECURE NETWORK. INTELINK~ HAS BECOME AN INFO SERVICE THAT IS CRITICAL TO THE IC. SWITCHED ON IN LATE 1994~ THE NETWORK IS NOW USED BY 50~000 ANALYSTS~ OPERATIVES~ MILITARY OFFICERS AND POLICYMAKERS WITH TOP-SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCES AT 100 SITES. THEY CAN CLICK ON THE LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY FROM NIMA~ SEARCH THE NETWORK FOR NSA INTERCEPTS AND CHAT ELECTRONICALLY WITH ANALYSTS. A HANDFUL OF COMPUTER MAVENS STARTED IT WITH COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SOFTWARE. WEB-BASED DATA SEARCHABLE ACROSS A VAST NETWORK FORCED THE IC TO RE-EXAMINE - AND ULTIMATELY WAIVE - ITS NEED-TO-KNOW DOCTRINE FOR DISSEMINATING INTEL. THE NETWORK IS IMPENETRABLE TO ATTACK BY HACKERS BECAUSE IT RUNS ON DEDICATED DEFENSE DEPARTMENT NETWORKS THAT HAVE NO LINK TO THE INTERNET. TO OPEN AN INTELINK ACCOUNT~ A USER MUST FIRST HAVE A TOP-SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCE. INTELINK TERMINALS ARE LOCATED ONLY INSIDE TOP-SECRET GOVT FACILITIES~ AND EVEN IF A HACKER SOMEHOW MANAGED TO TAP INTO A SECURE PENTAGON PHONE LINE AND INTERCEPTED RAW DATA~ HE WOULD STILL HAVE TO DEFEAT AN ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM.

IN RECENT MONTHS ALONE YOU WARNED US WHEN IRAQ MASSED ITS TROOPS AGAINST THE KUWAITI BORDER. YOU PROVIDED VITAL SUPPORT TO OUR PEACEKEEPING AND HUMANITARIAN MISSIONS IN HAITI AND RWANDA.

[TOP OFFICIALS]~ DID NOT EXPECT NUCLEAR TESTING BY INDIA~ AND INTEL ASSIGNED A LOW PRIORITY TO PROBLEMS ON THE SUBCONTINENT.

INTEL-POLICY,INDIA~ PAKISTAN~ @90@ ONE OF GREATEST CHALLENGES FACED BY AN INTEL SERVICE IS TO BE BELIEVED.

ANDREW GIVES AN EXAMPLE FROM 1990: CIA ANALYSTS BELIEVED THAT MILITARY BUILD UPS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE INDIAN- PAKISTANI BORDER MIGHT LEAD TO A NUCLEAR WAR. PRESIDENT BUSH SENT CIA DIRECTOR ROBERT GATES TO INDIA AND PAKISTAN. MR. GATES' JOB WAS TO CONVINCE LEADERS IN BOTH INDIA AND PAKISTAN THAT UNLESS THEY REDUCED THEIR TROOP STRENGTH ALONG BORDER~ THEY RISKED WAR. KEY TO GETTING HIS POINT ACROSS WAS FOR GATES TO CONVINCE BOTH INDIAN AND PAKISTANI LEADERS THAT CIA ASSESSMENT WAS ACCURATE. TO DO THIS~ GATES DETAILED FOR PAKISTANI LEADERS POSITION OF EVERY PAKISTANI MILITARY UNIT IN PAKISTAN. LATER~ GATES PROVIDED INDIAN LEADERS WITH SIMILAR DATA ABOUT INDIAN FORCES. THIS WAS INFO EACH SIDE COULD CHECK~ BECAUSE EACH MILITARY KNEW WHERE ITS OWN TROOPS WERE STATIONED. BECAUSE GATES PROVIDED LEADERS OF BOTH SIDES OF DISPUTE WITH INFO WHICH THEY COULD CHECK~ HE WAS BELIEVED WHEN HE EXPLAINED CIA ANALYSIS: THAT CONTINUED MILITARY BUILD-UP ON BOTH SIDES OF BORDER MIGHT LEAD TO A NUCLEAR WAR.

INTEL-POLICY,USSR~ @75-99@ CIA IS TRYING TO CONVINCE ITSELF AND US THAT IT PROVIDED TIMELY WARNINGS ABOUT THE IMPENDING COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION. THE LATEST REVISIONISM WAS IN A THREE-DAY CONFERENCE AT TEXAS A&M'S GEORGE BUSH SCHOOL OF GOVT AND PUBLIC SERVICE ON ^U.S. INTEL AND THE END OF THE COLD WAR.^ SIMULTANEOUSLY~ IT RELEASED A 378-PAGE VOLUME OF 24 NEWLY DECLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS THAT SHOWED CIA DID FAR BETTER ANTICIPATING THE USSR'S DEMISE IN 1991. THIS IS AN EXERCISE IN SELF-DECEPTION. CIA USES SLEIGHT OF HAND IN MAKING PUBLIC A SET OF DOCS PRODUCED FROM 1988 TO 1991. IT SHOULD EVALUATE ITSELF BY THE ENTIRE RECORD FROM THE 1980S~ PARTICULARLY AFTER GORBACHEV CAME TO POWER IN 1985. IF IT WERE BEING HONEST CIA WOULD SAY THAT IT HAD EXAGGERATED THE STRENGTH OF THE SOVIET MILITARY AND ECONOMY~ UNDERESTIMATED THE BURDEN OF SOVIET DEFENSE SPENDING AND IGNORED GORBACHEV'S EFFORTS TO ENGAGE THE U.S. IN A SERIES OF DISARMAMENT AGREEMENTS. THE RECORD SHOWS CIA DID NOT ANTICIPATE MOSCOW'S RETREAT ABROAD AND ITS VULNERABILITY AT HOME. THE COSTS OF FAILING TO ACHIEVE THESE MOST BASIC GOALS ARE TANGIBLE: THE HUGE DEFENSE BUDGETS OF THE REAGAN ERA; A NEEDLESSLY PROLONGED CONFRONTATION WITH MOSCOW; AND A LOST OPPORTUNITY TO INFLUENCE DEVELOPMENTS. GEORGE SHULTZ~ WHO WAS SECRETARY OF STATE~ AND COLIN POWELL~ REAGAN'S LAST NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER--HAVE SAID THEY WERE NOT WELL SERVED BY THE CIA. PART OF THE PROBLEM WAS POLITICAL: DCI CASEY ONLY WANTED INFO TO SUPPORT HIS VIEWS. IN 1985~ CASEY AND HIS DDI~ ROBERT GATES~ ORCHESTRATED A NONEXISTENT SOVIET PLOT AGAINST POPE JOHN PAUL II. AND A WILDLY OFF-THE-MARK ESTIMATE OF A SOVIET THREAT TO IRAN TO JUSTIFY ARMS SALES TO SO-CALLED MODERATES IN TEHRAN. CIA ECONOMISTS TRACKED THE EARLY STAGES OF DECLINE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY FROM 1976 TO 1986~ BUT GATES WOULD NOT CIRCULATE MOST DRAFT WEAKNESS ASSESSMENTS. AS A RESULT~ CIA ESTIMATES OVERSTATED SIZE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY AND UNDERESTIMATED THE BURDEN OF MAINTAINING THE SOVIET MILITARY. CIA ESTIMATED THE SIZE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY TO BE NEARLY 60 PERCENT THAT OF THE U.S. ECONOMY AND SAID THE GROWTH RATE OF PERSONAL CONSUMPTION FROM 1951 TO 1988 EXCEEDED THE U.S.'S. (AS LATE AS 1986~ CIA SAID EAST GERMANY WAS AHEAD OF WEST GERMANY IN PER CAPITA OUTPUT.) THE REAGAN ADM USED THESE NUMBERS TO JUSTIFY NEARLY $2 TRILLION IN TOTAL DEFENSE SPENDING IN THE 1980S.

INTEL-POLICY,USSR~ @81-93@ CASEY AND GATES DID THEIR GREATEST DAMAGE BY INFLUENCING CIA'S ESTIMATES OF USSR MILITARY STRENGTH. EXAGGERATED ESTIMATES OF THE RED ARMY'S MILITARY POWER WERE USED TO JUSTIFY INCREASED DEFENSE SPENDING AND THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INTEL FAILURE SINCE PEARL HARBOR - THE FAILURE TO CHART THE WEAKNESS AND COLLAPSE OF THE USSR. GATES AS DEPUTY AND ACTING DIRECTOR FROM 86 TO 89 SLANTED NIES ON SOVIET STRATEGIC DEFENSE SPENDING TO BUTTRESS CASE FOR THE STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE. CIA EXAGGERATED BOTH THE FLIGHT RANGE OF THE TU-22 BACKFIRE BOMBER AND THE ACCURACY OF THE SS-19 ICBM - ERRORS ADMITTED BY CIA IN 89~ AFTER GATES LEFT - BUT THEY CONTINUED TO APPEAR IN A DIA PUBLICATION ^SOVIET MILITARY POWER~^ A PROPAGANDA VEHICLE FOR THE PENTAGON. CIA ASSESSMENTS AND NIES OVERSTATED EVERY ASPECT OF USSR MILITARY AND PROVIDED NO WARNING OF THE USSR WITHDRAWAL FORM AFGHANISTAN~ CAN RANH BAY IN VIETNAM OR THE LITTORAL STATES OF AFRICA.

INTEL-POLICY,USSR. CIA ESTIMATES USSR SPENDS MUCH MORE ON DEFENSE THAN U.S. HOWEVER~ METHODOLOGY FOR CIA CALCULATIONS IS GROSSLY FLAWED. CORRECTED FIGURES SHOW THAT U.S. SPENDS MORE THAN USSR. KEY ERROR IS THAT CIA PRICES ELEMENTS OF SOVIET DEFENSE -- SOLDIER WAGES~ WEAPONS COSTS ETC -- AT U.S. WAGE AND PRICE VALUES. FINAL FIGURE IS WHAT IT WOULD COST U.S. TO REPRODUCE SOVIET MILITARY~ WHICH NEGLECTS LOWER SOVIET ARMY WAGES. ALSO~ CIA CONVERTS RUBLES INTO DOLLARS WHICH DISTORTS REAL VALUE OF EXPENSES. FINALLY~ CIA ASSESSMENT OF SUPERPOWER MILITARIES BASED ON EXPENSES IS FLAWED BECAUSE IT DOES NOT FACTOR IN SUPERIOR U.S. TECHNOLOGY. CIA FIGURES ARE CLEARLY USED TO JUSTIFY U.S. DEFENSE BUILD-UP.

SECOND~ HE CAME TO BELIEVE THAT ESPIONAGE BUSINESS~ AS CARRIED OUT BY CIA AND A FEW OTHER AMERICAN AGENCIES~ WAS AND IS A SELF-SERVING SHAM~ CARRIED OUT BY CAREERIST BUREAUCRATS WHO HAVE MANAGED TO DECEIVE SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF AMERICAN POLICYMAKERS AND PUBLIC ABOUT BOTH NECESSITY AND VALUE OF THEIR WORK. PRECIS HIS STATEMENT: THERE IS AND HAS BEEN NO RATIONAL NEED FOR THOUSANDS OF CASE OFFICERS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AGENTS WORKING AROUND WORLD~ PRIMARILY IN AN AGAINST FRIENDLY COUNTRIES. INFO GATHERED BY OUR VAST ESPIONAGE NETWORK ACQUIRES AT CONSIDERABLE HUMAN AND ETHICAL COSTS IS GENERALLY INSIGNIFICANT OR IRRELEVANT TO OUR POLICYMAKERS' NEEDS. OUR ESPIONAGE ESTABLISHMENT DIFFERS HARDLY AT ALL FROM MANY FEDERAL BUREAUCRACIES~ HAVING TRANSFORMED ITSELF INTO SELF-SERVING INTEREST GROUP~ IMMEASURABLY AIDED BY SECRECY. NOW THAT COLD WAR IS OVER AND COMMUNIST TYRANNIES LARGELY DONE FOR~ OUR COUNTRY STILL AWAITS A REAL NATIONAL DEBATE ON MEANS AND ENDS - AND COSTS - OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY POLICIES. JUST AS NEED TO ASK WHY WE NEED 12 CARRIER BATTLE GROUPS~ NEW GENERATIONS OF FIGHTERS AND BOMBERS AND THOUSANDS OF ICBMs AND SCBMs~ WE NEED TO QUESTION~ AS ONLY A FEW HAVE DONE~ OUR REAL NEEDS FOR INTEL COLLECTION~ INCLUDING HIGHLY SUSPECT TOOL OF ESPIONAGE.

WE HAVE ASKED THE DCI TO BEGIN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW....THE MOST SHOCKING REVELATION TO COME OUT OF THESE LATEST REPORTS WAS THIS: BY FAILING TO ADEQUATELY INFORM UNITED STATES CONSUMERS OF INTELLIGENCE -- INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT~ THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE -- THAT THE DIRECTORATE OF OPERATIONS~ WAS PASSING ALONG TO THEM INTELLIGENCE FROM CONTROLLED RUSSIAN AGENTS~ THIS ARM OF THE CIA WAS TAKING AN ENORMOUS RISK THAT MAY HAVE JEOPARDIZED U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS. THE REPORTS OFFICER [NOW RETIRED] CONCEDED THAT HE KNEW THE DATA CAME FROM CONTROLLED SOURCES AND THAT HE DISSEMINATED THE DATA WITH NO WARNING. HE FELT HE ACTED ENTIRELY PROPERLY BECAUSE HE BELIEVED THE INFORMATION WAS TRUE AND THAT DISCLOSURE OF THE CONTROLLED SOURCES WOULD HAVE MADE IT HARDER TO ^SELL^ THE INTELLIGENCE. THIS REPORTS OFFICER~ SERVED FOR 40 YEARS. IT IS HARD TO COMPREHEND HOW HE FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THAT HIS CONDUCT POSED A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY~ AND HOW HIS SUPERIORS COULD PERMIT HIM TO FUNCTION IN THIS MANNER.

REPORTS CLAIMED THE USSR WAS DEVELOPING NEW AND DANGEROUS WEAPONS SYSTEMS. THE CIA APPARENTLY BELIEVED THE PLANTED REPORTS AND DISSEMINATED THEM TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS CAUSED THE UNITED STATES TO APPARENTLY SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DEVELOP WEAPONS TO MEET THE NEW BUT FALSE CHALLENGE. CIABASE POST. NEW INFO FROM <WT 4/11/96 A12
INTEL~ ORG,@96@ WHITE HOUSE'S MOST BACKWARD STEP IS ENDORSING OF A NATIONAL IMAGERY AND MAPPING AGENCY AT THE DOD AS A COMBAT SUPPORT AGENCY. ALLOWING THE MILITARY TO DOMINATE THIS IMPORTANT FIELD CREATES MAJOR RISKS. IMAGERY ANALYSIS HAS BEEN USED TO CALIBRATE THE DEFENSE BUDGET~ TO GAUGE THE LIKELIHOOD OF MILITARY CONFLICT IN THE THIRD WORLD~ AND TO VERIFY ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS. RECENTLY CIA PHOTO INTERPRETERS FOUND A PATTERN OF GENOCIDAL CRIMES IN BOSNIA~ AS WELL AS ARMS SHIPMENTS. BOTH FINDINGS EMBARRASSED THE PRESIDENT - WHICH MAY EXPLAIN THE DECISION TO ABOLISH NPIC. THE NIXON ADM ABOLISHED THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL ESTIMATES AFTER A SERIES OF ARMS-CONTROL POLICY BATTLES BETWEEN THE VIA AND NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER HENRY KISSINGER. STATE DEPARTMENT'S BUREAU OR INTEL AND RESEARCH (INR) HAS BEEN THE MOST INDEPENDENT AND PROFESSIONAL OF THE GOVERNMENT'S 13 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES; ALLOWING THE CIA DIRECTOR TO APPROVE THE HEAD OF INR WOULD WEAKEN ITS CREDIBILITY.
