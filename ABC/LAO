BECAUSE OF RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON MILITARY PRESENCE AND OPERATIONS IN LAOS BY INCREASINGLY IRRELEVANT INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS~ THIS WAR BECAME THE NEARLY EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY OF CIA. BECAUSE OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE AREA AND THE NEED FOR A SITE THAT WOULD BE WITHIN RADIO AND RADAR RANGE OF NORTH VIETNAM--A DIFFICULT PROBLEM IN THE RUGGED TERRAIN OF LAOS--NORTH VIETNAM BORDER AREA~ THE AIR FORCE IN 1966 INSTALLED A TACAN TRANSMITTER ON PHOU PHATHI.

TO SUPPORT OPERATION OF THE STATION ON PHOU PHATHI~ THE AIR FORCE ROTATED SEVERAL TECHNICIANS TO AND FROM THE ROCK FOR MAINTENANCE AND RESUPPLY OF THE TRANSMITTER AND ITS ASSOCIATED GENERATOR.

IN HIS BOOK~ THE AUTHOR DISCLOSES HOW THE BVD BROKE INTO COMMUNIST PARTY (CPN) HEADQUARTERS BUILDINGS HUNDREDS OF TIMES IN SO-CALLED ^BLACK BAG JOBS^ AND OVER THE YEARS MANAGED TO PHOTOCOPY ALMOST ALL OF THE CPN ARCHIVES. THE BVD~ IN THE EARLY 1960S~ RAN WELL OVER A HUNDRED AGENTS IN VARIOUS CPN COUNCILS. HOMES OF PROMINENT COMMUNISTS WERE BUGGED FOR DECADES AND THE BVD EVEN SET UP A FAKE ^SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY^ (SWP) OF SEVERAL HUNDRED MEMBERS TO STIR UP FACTIONAL CONFLICTS AND CAUSE A SPLIT IN COMMUNIST RANKS~ WHICH CAME ABOUT IN 1958. THE SCENARIO WAS THOUGHT OUT BY THE CIA~ WHICH IN THE 1950S PAID NEARLY TEN PERCENT OF ALL BVD PERSONNEL AND HAD A PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON THE ORGANIZATION.

THE IDB WAS RELOCATED TO THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. A STEP WHICH CAUSED OPPOSITION FROM THE LEADERS OF THE MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE COUNCIL OF STATE WHO WERE NOT CONSULTED ABOUT THIS DECISION. DE JONG'S GENERAL ATTITUDE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE VIEWS MOST DUTCH PRIME MINISTERS HAD WITH RESPECT TO THE IDB: DISINTEREST~ NEGLECT AND HARDLY ANY RECOGNITION OF THE VITAL ROLE INTEL CAN PLAY IN GOVERNMENTAL DECISIONMAKING. IDB ITSELF WAS PARTLY TO BLAME. ON THE WHOLE~ THE QUALITY OF ITS INTEL OUTPUT WAS MEAGER~ AS WAS CONFIRMED TO THE AUTHORS BY OFFICIALS FROM THE CIA AND MI6. THERE WAS CONTINUOUS COMPETITION WITH OTHER NETHERLANDS INTEL AND SECURITY SERVICES~ LIKE THE STAY-BEHIND-ORGANIZATION SAZ (DUTCH GLADIO)~ THAT WAS LOCATED IN THE SAME BUILDING. THERE WERE ALSO INTERNAL BATTLES WITH THE BVD~ WHICH OFTEN MANEUVERED THE IDB IN A CORNER AS FAR AS TO CONTACT WITH OTHER FOREIGN SERVICES. THIS HAPPENED FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE BVD AND THE CIA STATION IN THE HAGUE DURING THE HIJACKINGS AND SEIZURES IN THE 1970'S. DURING THAT PERIOD THERE WAS ALSO A JOINT COVERT BVD/CIA OP AGAINST THE CHINESE EMBASSY AND MAOIST GROUPS~ AMONG THEM WHAT WOULD LATER BECOME THE SOCIALIST PARTY.

LIAISON,NETHERLANDS~ INDONESIA~ @50-99@ A BIG SUCCESSES OF THE DUTCH INTEL SERVICE~ IDB~ WAS THE RECRUITMENT OF ITS INDONESIAN SOURCES. DUE TO ITS AGENT ^VIRGIL^ THE SERVICE RECRUITED SEVERAL INFLUENTIAL INDONESIAN DIPLOMATS BUT ALSO A CONFIDANT OF THE INDONESIAN PRESIDENT SUKARNO~ RUSLAN ABDULGANI. HE FROM 1946 WAS AN INFLUENTIAL ADVISOR OF SUKARNO AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER IN 1956-1957. ABDULGANI AND OTHER INDONESIAN AGENTS PASSED ON VITAL INFO WHICH HELPED THE IDB TO BREAK SECRET DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY COMMO. ONE OF THESE AGENTS IN THE LATE FIFTIES ALSO PASSED ON THE INDONESIAN MILITARY PLAN FOR THE ATTACK ON THE DUTCH ISLAND OF NEW GUINEA. THESE DISCLOSURES SHEDS LIGHT ON THE ATTITUDE OF THE DUTCH SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS~ JOSEPH LUNS~ DURING HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE INDONESIANS. DURING THE NEW GUINEA AFFAIR NOT ONLY NATIONALISM AND STUBBORNNESS DROVE HIM. THE ATTITUDE OF LUNS~ LATER TO BECOME SECRETARY-GENERAL OF NATO~ MUST ALSO BE EXPLAINED BECAUSE HE WAS WELL AWARE OF MOST OF THE SECRET PLANS OF THE INDONESIAN GOVT. IT IS STRIKING HOW STUBBORN AND LITTLE GRATIFYING THE DUTCH AUTHORITIES WERE TOWARDS THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THIS COVERT OP. VIGIL'S ALLOWANCES WERE SO LOW~ EVEN WITH FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE CIA~ THAT IN THE END IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO CONTINUE HIS WORK. THIS DID LEAD TO A FOULED UP (?) ATTEMPT BY MI6 TO RECRUIT VIRGIL. AFTER FINISHING HIS WORK~ THE AUTHORITIES WERE AGAIN NOT VERY WILLING TO HELP VIRGIL WHO WAS DROPPED.

LIAISON,NETHERLANDS~ ISRAEL~ @72-94@ IN 1972~ THE IDB ^RETURNED^ TO THE CABINET OFFICE AND BECAME A SMOOTH RUNNING ORGANIZATION WHICH PRODUCED EXCELLENT INTEL. MORE AND MORE ANALYSIS WAS DONE AND LESS AND LESS RAW INTEL WAS DELIVERED TO THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND THE FOREIGN INTEL COMMUNITY. THE INTERNAL QUARRELING INCREASED AGAIN CAUSED BY THE CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN STAFF. MOST OF THE MANAGEMENT AND OPS WORKERS HAD A MILITARY BACKGROUND WHILE THE CIVILIANS WERE PRIMARILY ACADEMICS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANALYSIS. INTERNAL DISAGREEMENTS MOUNTED BECAUSE OF THE DUBIOUS SUPPORT TO THE MOSSAD WHICH ENABLED THE ISRAELI AIRFORCE TO ATTACK THE NUCLEAR REACTOR IN OSIRAK~ IRAQ. ALSO INTEL ABOUT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT OF NAMIBIA~ SWAPO~ WHICH WAS HANDED OVER TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN APARTHEID REGIME~ CAUSED INTERNAL TURMOIL. THE TENSIONS INCREASED AND FAILING SUPERVISION BY THE CABINET OFFICE LED TO AN EXPLOSION IN THE EARLY 1980'S WHEN MOST OF THE ACADEMICS LEFT THE IDB. THE STATUS OF THE IDB ALSO RECEIVED A SEVERE BLOW WHEN IN DECEMBER 1983 AN ISRAELI `MOLE' INSIDE THE IDB WAS ARRESTED. IT WAS MAJOR IJSBRAND SMIT WHO CAME FROM THE DUTCH AIRFORCE INTEL SERVICE. SMIT LATER WORKED AT THE ORGANIZATION SECTION OF THE STAFF OFFICE OF THE PLANS AND INTEL DIVISION OF THE SUPREME HEADQUARTERS ALLIED POWERS IN EUROPE (SHAPE) IN MONS/BERGEN. THIS DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COORDINATION AND DISSEMINATION OF ALL NATO-INTEL WITHIN THE ALLIED COMMAND EUROPE~ INCLUDING INTEL POLICY AND BASIC INTEL DOCUMENTS. THE MOSSAD COULD NOT HAVE WISHED A BETTER MOLE. SMIT WAS PROMOTED TO HEAD OF THE ANALYSIS BRANCH OF THE IDB WHICH GAVE HIM DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCES~ TOP SECRET REPORTS AND OPS~ DOCS FROM THE FOREIGN INTEL COMMUNITY AND~ DUTCH INTERCEPTS. THESE COULD TELL MOSSAD THE NETHERLANDS CODEBREAKING CAPABILITIES AND SUCCESSES. THE ARREST OF SMIT CAUSED A ROW BECAUSE SMIT GAVE ISRAEL PROBABLY ALSO NATO AND OTHER FOREIGN DOCS. ISRAELI PRIME MISTER SHAMIR INTERVENED WITH QUEEN BEATRIX IN ORDER TO ARRANGE FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS DUTCH POLLARD. ISRAEL SUCCEEDED AND SMIT~ WAS ALLOWED TO EMIGRATE TO ISRAEL.
