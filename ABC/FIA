NOW~ U.S. OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EPISODE HAS HAD FAR GRAVER CONSEQUENCES. BUNGLED OP FORCED CIA TO SUSPEND VIRTUALLY ALL ITS OPS IN FRANCE EARLIER THIS YEAR. SUSPENSION~ ORDERED BY CIA HQS APPARENTLY LEFT THE AGENCY WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IN ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT HUBS FOR ESPIONAGE IN THE POST- COLD WAR WORLD. A CIA SOURCE SAID A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WARNED AN AGENCY CASE OFFICER IN PARIS NOT EVEN TO CONDUCT CLANDESTINE OPS AGAINST NON-FRENCH TARGETS INSIDE FRANCE. PARIS FIASCO MAY HAVE HAD A CHILLING EFFECT ON CIA'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT SPYING OPS ELSEWHERE IN WESTERN EUROPE. EPISODE SO ANGERED FRENCH THAT THEY MAY HAVE SHARED INFO ABOUT CIA'S ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE OPS WITH OTHER EUROPEAN INTEL SERVICES~ INCLUDING THOSE IN GERMANY AND ITALY. INCIDENT HAS PROMPTED AN INVESTIGATION BY CIA'S INSPECTOR GENERAL~ FRED HITZ~ WHO IS TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER AGENCY OFFICIALS FAILED TO PROPERLY NOTIFY AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN. HITZ IS ALSO TRYING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER CARELESSNESS BY CIA AGENTS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR OP'S EXPOSURE -- WHAT THE CIA CALLS IN SPY JARGON ^POOR TRADE-CRAFT.^ HITZ INVESTIGATION IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF YEAR. CASE HAS FRUSTRATED SENIOR LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL~ SOME OF WHOM COMPLAIN CIA ONCE AGAIN FAILED TO KEEP CONGRESS ADEQUATELY INFORMED. ^THEY DIDN'T TELL US ANYTHING BEFORE OP BLEW~^ SAID ONE MEMBER OF SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTEL. ^THEY ONLY TOLD US ABOUT THIS AT TIME THAT IT WAS HITTING THE PAPERS.^ THIS IS THE LATEST SKIRMISH IN AN ECONOMIC SPY WAR THAT HAS BEEN UNDER WAY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND FRANCE FOR YEARS. U.S. OFFICIALS ACCUSE THE FRENCH INTEL SERVICE OF REPEATEDLY CONDUCTING CLANDESTINE OPS TO PRY INDUSTRIAL SECRETS OUT OF U.S. CORPORATIONS~ ANGERING BOTH THE CIA AND THE FBI. IN FRENCH OP~ THE CIA WAS~ IN EFFECT~ SPYING FOR HOLLYWOOD: AT LEAST PART OF THE MISSION WAS REPORTEDLY DESIGNED TO DETERMINE STRENGTH OF THE FRENCH BARGAINING POSITION IN TELEVISION AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. U.S. WAS OPPOSED TO FRENCH DEMANDS TO RESTRICT IMPORTS OF U.S. TELEVISION PROGRAMMING INTO EUROPE. OP WAS BLOWN WHEN FRENCH UNCOVERED ONE OF SPIES~ A PART-TIME CONTRACT EMPLOYEE WITH CIA. FRENCH THEN TRAILED HER~ EVENTUALLY CONNECTING HER WITH FOUR CIA CASE OFFICERS~ WHO WERE OPERATING UNDER DIPLOMATIC COVER OUT OF U.S. EMBASSY IN PARIS. SPY WHOSE COVER WAS FIRST BLOWN HAD HAD PROBLEMS IN PREVIOUS OPS~ CIA HQS HAD BEEN RELUCTANT TO USE HER AGAIN. BUT THE PARIS STATION CHIEF DECIDED TO LET HER PARTICIPATE ANYWAY. IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE CIA HAS RESUMED ITS PARIS OPS. CIA HAS NAMED A REPLACEMENT FOR FORMER PARIS STATION CHIEF DICK HOLM~ SOURCES COULD NOT SAY WHETHER NEW CHIEF HAS ARRIVED IN FRANCE. POTENTIAL FOR SPY WARS AMONG ALLIES IN THE POST-COLD WAR ERA SEEMS TO BE GENERATING FRICTION IN EUROPE. NEW REPUBLIC MAGAZINE SAID DCI DEUTCH WAS WARNED DURING A SUMMER TRIP TO BONN THAT GERMAN OFFICIALS WOULD FIGHT CIA EFFORTS TO ENGAGE IN ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE INSIDE THEIR COUNTRY. THEY ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE CIA SCALE BACK ITS STAFF IN GERMANY. DEUTCH ALSO TRAVELED TO PARIS THIS SUMMER IN AN EFFORT TO SMOOTH RELATIONS WITH BOTH FRANCE AND HARRIMAN. <LAT 10/11/95 A1

WHEN THE FLAP WENT PUBLIC~ LEE'S NAME WAS NO LONGER ON THE LIST~ BUT HE WAS DEFINITELY IN THE FRENCH ESTABLISHMENT'S ^BLACK BOOK^ AND BY LATE JANUARY HE WAS RECEIVING DEATH THREATS. CIA CONSIDERED THEM SERIOUS ENOUGH TO ADVISE LEE TO LEAVE FRANCE. IN MID-1992~ LEE HAD TAKEN A PART-TIME POSITION WITH THE NEW YORK-BASED INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE FIRM~ KROLL ASSOCIATES~ WHICH FRENCH DST COUNTER-ESPIONAGE CONSIDERS TO BE A COVER FOR CIA ACTIVITY IN FRANCE. HE ALSO FOUNDED HIS OWN COMPANY~ TRIANGLE~ IN PARIS. ALL THIS ^ADDS UP^ IN THE FRENCH INTEL BOOK~ BUT THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK WAS PROBABLY WHEN LEE WENT TO COURT AGAINST MAJOR FRENCH ARMS MANUFACTURER MATRA CHARGING THAT ITS MERGER WITH PUBLISHING GIANT HACHETTE DID NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION A SECRET $1.5 BILLION MATRA CONTRACT WITH TAIWAN~ THUS CHEATING MATRA SHAREHOLDERS. THE ANTE WAS SERIOUSLY UPPED ON 9/16/94 WHEN THE ACCUSATION WARNED IT WOULD DISCLOSE COMMISSION PAYMENTS MADE BY MATRA AND OTHER FRENCH COMPANIES TO TAIWAN. THIS WAS JUST TOO CLOSE TO THE CIA'S DECLARED INTENTION OF ^LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD^ BY REVEALING MASSIVE KICKBACKS PAID BY FOREIGN COMPANIES TO OBTAIN LARGE INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS.

FLAP,GERMANY~ @97@ 3/15/97~ ^DER SPIEGEL^ NAMED PEYTON K. HUMPHRIES AS THE CIA OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN ASKED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY FOR TRYING TO RECRUIT A DEPARTMENT CHIEF OF THE GERMAN ECONOMICS MINISTRY AND OBTAIN INFO ON RELATIONS BETWEEN GERMANY AND IRAN. CIA'S REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED HIGH TECH GERMAN COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS WITH IRAN~ IRANIAN INTEL INVOLVEMENT IN 1992 MYKONOS RESTAURANT MURDERS IN BERLIN~ GERMAN GOVERNMENT PAYMENT GUARANTEES FOR IRANIAN EXPORTS~ AND NEW WORK AND FINANCING OF THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BUILT BY THE SIEMENS IN IRAN IN THE 1970S. THE ECONOMICS MINISTRY CONTACTED BFV COUNTER-ESPIONAGE IN 1995~ INFORMING IT THAT AN AMERICAN AGENT~ HUMPHRIES' PREDECESSOR~ HAD BEEN MEETING WITH THE MINISTRY DEPARTMENT CHIEF RESPONSIBLE FOR IRAN~ SINCE 1994. THE BFV~ LIKE FRENCH DST COUNTER-ESPIONAGE IN EARLY 1995~ TOLD THE OFFICIAL TO CONTINUE MEETING THE AMERICAN AGENT. IN BOTH CASES~ THIS ENABLED THE CE SERVICE TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF CIA PERSONS AND INTENTIONS. HUMPHRIES' PREDECESSOR LEFT IN MAY 1996 BUT INTRODUCED HUMPHRIES TO THE OFFICIAL BEFORE DEPARTURE. BFV CHIEF~ PETER PRISCH~ TOLD CIA TO GET HUMPHRIES OUT OF GERMANY BY 30 MAY. THE U.S. RELUCTANCE TO COMPLY PUSHED THIS STORY ONTO THE FRONT PAGES.

BUT WHAT PERMITTED FRENCH TO CATCH THE CIA~ WAS ITS WOMAN AGENT WHOSE TRADECRAFT WAS SO BAD THAT IN HER PREVIOUS POST ... IN BONN~ GERMAN BFV INTERNAL SECURITY HAD EASILY IDENTIFIED HER AS A CIA AGENT AND PASSED THE INFO TO DST. THE 3/10 LEAK OF THIS EXPULSION IN THE PRESS FOLLOWS WARNINGS BY GERMAN INTEL ^CZAR~^ SCHMIDBAUER~ RE CIA RELUCTANCE TO REDUCING ITS OFFICERS IN GERMANY. BUT~ THE [REAL PROBLEM IS] THE U.S. REATTACKED EUROPE'S FLEDGLING AUTONOMY IN STRATEGIC RECONNAISSANCE. GERMANY AND FRANCE WERE ABLE TO WORK OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES RE HELIOS-2 SURVEILLANCE SATELLITE PROGRAM~ AND THIS WAS DONE IN THE FACE OF MAJOR U.S. PRESSURE FOR GERMANY TO BUY A ^CHEAPER OFF-THE-SHELF^ U.S. SATELLITE. HAVING APPARENTLY LOST THAT BATTLE TO AVOID AN AUTONOMOUS EUROPEAN STRATEGIC RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEM~ THE U.S. DID THE NEXT BEST THING: PROPOSE THAT EUROPE COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. IN DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING WORLDWIDE THE FORTHCOMING HIGH-TECH U.S. DRONES~ GLOBAL HAWK AND DARK STAR.

IT MARKED ONLY THE SECOND TIME SINCE WORLD WAR II THAT GERMANY HAS MADE PUBLIC THAT IT HAD SOUGHT REMOVAL OF AMERICAN AGENTS. BOTH OCCURRED IN THE PAST TWO YEARS. GERMAN OFFICIALS SAID THE AMERICANS VIOLATED LONG-STANDING PRACTICE BY FAILING TO MAKE THEIR ACTIVITIES KNOWN TO GERMANY'S DOMESTIC INTEL AGENCY. THE THREE WERE NOT ACCREDITED AS DIPLOMATS~ AS IS CUSTOMARY FOR INTEL PERSONNEL~ AND THAT ONLY ONE OF THEM WORKED AT THE MUNICH CONSULATE.

IN APRIL 1990~ JUST FOUR WEEKS BEFORE I WAS CAR-BOMBED IN OAKLAND~ THE FBI HELD A BOMB INVESTIGATORS' TRAINING COURSE AT THE COLLEGE OF THE REDWOODS IN EUREKA~ CA. DURING WEEK-LONG COURSE~ OPEN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ONLY~ FBI BLEW UP CARS WITH PIPE BOMBS AND PRACTICED RESPONDING. HEAD INSTRUCTOR WAS SPECIAL AGENT FRANK DOYLE~ FBI TERRORIST SQUAD BOMB EXPERT WHO SHOWED UP AT SCENE WHEN I WAS BOMBED IN OAKLAND AND DIRECTED COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE. AMONG STUDENTS AND PARTICIPANTS AT BOMB SCHOOL WERE AT LEAST FOUR OF THE OAKLAND POLICE AND FBI AGENTS WHO RESPONDED TO THE OAKLAND BOMBING AND COLLECTED THE EVIDENCE UNDER FRANK DOYLE'S SUPERVISION. IT WAS FRANK DOYLE WHO CONCOCTED THE LIE THAT THE BOMB IN MY CAR WAS LOCATED ON THE BACK SEAT FLOORBOARD WHERE WE WOULD HAVE SEEN IT~ WHEN IN FACT THE DAMAGE TO THE CAR CLEARLY SHOWED THAT THE BOMB WAS HIDDEN UNDER MY CAR SEAT. THIS LIE WAS USED AS A PRINCIPAL JUSTIFICATION IN ARRESTING DARRYL AND ME FOR SUPPOSEDLY TRANSPORTING THE BOMB. FRANK DOYLE'S BOMB SCHOOL STUDENTS WENT ALONG WITH HIS LIE. THE BOMB WAS HIDDEN UNDER MY CAR SEAT~ AND IT WAS TRIGGERED BY A MOTION DEVICE CONSISTING OF A LARGE BALL BEARING THAT HAD TO ROLL TO CONNECT TWO CONTACT POINTS. IT WAS A BOOBY TRAP BOMB. THIS DISCREDITS THE FBI'S STORY THAT DARRYL AND I WERE KNOWINGLY TRANSPORTING THIS BOMB TO USE IN SOME KIND OF ECOTAGE ACTION. BEHAVIOR OF THE FBI IN THIS CASE IS REMINISCENT OF SOME OF THE WORST ABUSES FROM THE DAYS OF J. EDGAR HOOVER AND COINTELPRO.

THE PROMISE IS UNFULFILLED. A PANEL OF OUTSIDE EXPERTS HIRED BY CIA CITES ^A CLASH OF CULTURES^ PITTING COLD WARRIORS AGAINST OPEN-MINDED HISTORIANS. ANOTHER FACTOR MAY BE THAT AGENCY HAS DEVOTED ONLY THREE TEN-THOUSANDTHS OF ITS BUDGET AND SEVEN FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES TO TASK OF MAKING DOCS PUBLIC. A STACK OF SECRET FILES TALLER THAN 50 WASHINGTON MONUMENTS AWAITS THEM. CIA BLAMES OLIVER STONE BECAUSE STONE'S 91 MOVIE~ ^JFK~^ PROVOKED CONGRESS TO ESTABLISH A JFK RECORDS LAW IN 92 THAT ORDERED FILES ON THE ASSASSINATION TO BE MADE PUBLIC. CLINTON TOOK NEARLY A YEAR TO NAME MEMBERS OF A REVIEW BOARD.

DCI DEUTCH~ HAS DOUBLED THE BUDGET. DEUTCH HAS ALSO DOUBLED THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF AN OUTSIDE GROUP OF HISTORIANS~ CALLED CIA HISTORICAL REVIEW PANEL~ WHICH PRODS THE DECLASSIFICATION PROCESS.
