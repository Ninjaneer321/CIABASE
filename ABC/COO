U.S. IS DEBATING WHETHER TO SUPPLY SOPHISTICATED COMMO~ INTEL SUPPORT AND TRAINING TO THE MILITARY IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF COLOMBIA~ WHERE THOUSANDS OF GUERRILLAS ARE PROTECTING DRUG TRAFFICKERS. 726 COLOMBIAN TROOPS RECEIVED TRAINING -- MOST OF IT NOT DESIGNATED AS COUNTERNARCOTICS COURSES -- FROM THE DOD'S SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND IN FISCAL 1996. THE INSTRUCTION -- INCLUDING SMALL UNIT RIVER AND COASTAL OPS AND LIGHT INFANTRY TECHNIQUES -- WAS BY ARMY SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES AND NAVY SEALS. THE TRAINING~ WHICH CONTINUES THIS YEAR~ WAS EXEMPTED FROM RESTRICTIONS AT THE TIME OF U.S. MILITARY AID TO COLOMBIA. AID TO COLOMBIA'S MILITARY HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT SINCE THE LATE 1980S BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN ARMY~ AS WELL AS THE RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY GROUPS THAT OPERATE WITH ITS SUPPORT~ HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN SCORES OF CIVILIAN MASSACRES~ DISAPPEARANCES AND CASES OF TORTURE. AID TO THE MILITARY WAS FORMALLY CUT OFF IN 1996 BECAUSE PRESIDENT ERNESTO SAMPER TOOK $6.1 MILLION FROM THE CALI COCAINE CARTEL FOR HIS 1994 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND AFTER U.S. OFFICIALS CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS NOT COOPERATING FULLY IN FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKERS. COLOMBIA IS THE LARGEST RECIPIENT OF U.S. COUNTERNARCOTICS AID IN SOUTH AMERICA~ INCLUDING 200 U.S. TROOPS STATIONED MOSTLY AT RADAR SITES THAT MONITOR SUSPECTED DRUG-CARRYING AIRCRAFT.

THE GOVT HAS A DETERIORATING MILITARY SITUATION; LACK OF RESULTS IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE LARGEST OF SEVERAL ARMED REBEL GROUPS~ THE 20~000-STRONG REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA; AND A FAILING ECONOMY. MILITARY AID TO COLOMBIA IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT REBEL FORCES OCCUPY MOST OF THE COUNTRY'S DRUG-PRODUCING AREAS -- WHERE THEY CONTROL THE PEASANTS WHO GROW THE DRUG CROPS~ FACILITATE EXPORTS AND TAX TRAFFICKERS -- AND ARE FIGHTING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT. ALTHOUGH THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY IS CHARGED WITH FIGHTING THE REBELS~ THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE PRIMARY ANTI-NARCOTICS RESPONSIBILITY~ AND THE TASKS FREQUENTLY OVERLAP. REPUBLICANS HAVE ARGUED THAT A MAJOR PORTION OF U.S. AID SHOULD GO TO THE POLICE AS PART OF AN ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM~ WHILE THE ADM -- WITH STRONG PENTAGON INPUT -- HAS SAID THAT ONLY THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY CAN ROUST THE INSURGENTS PERMANENTLY FROM DRUG-PRODUCING AREAS~ PRIMARILY IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL INCLUDES SOME ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT~ WEAPONS AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT FOR THE POLICE. BUT IT PROVIDES MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN TRAINING~ LOGISTICAL AND INTEL SUPPORT FOR THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY~ AS WELL AS UPGRADED EQUIPMENT.

COUNTERINTEL,CHINA~ @85-99@ U.S. HAS BEEN SILENT ABOUT WHAT U.S. INTEL AGENCIES LEARNED DURING VISITS BY CHINESE SCIENTISTS TO U.S. WEAPONS LABS AND TRIPS BY U.S. SCIENTISTS TO CHINA'S NUCLEAR RESEARCH FACILITIES. ^WE GOT MORE OUT OF THOSE CHINESE VISITS THAN THEY GOT~^ SAID RICHARD KERR~ A FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CIA WHO SERVED THIS YEAR ON AN INTEL COMMUNITY PANEL THAT REVIEWED CHINESE ESPIONAGE AT AMERICA'S NUCLEAR LABS. IN THE EARLY 80'S~ WE KNEW LITTLE ABOUT CHINA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND MISSILES. YEARS OF EXCHANGES OF HUNDREDS OF SCIENTISTS FROM BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE FILLED IN SOME OF THE BLANKS. ONE KEY DOCUMENT ILLUSTRATES BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN. IN 1995~ A CHINESE INTEL OFFICER OSTENSIBLY SEEKING TO BECOME A U.S. AGENT GAVE THE CIA A CHINESE MILITARY PAPER THAT CONTAINED DATA ON THE W-88~ AMERICA'S NEWEST NUCLEAR WARHEAD~ AND PUBLICLY INFO ON FIVE OTHER U.S. NUCLEAR WARHEADS. KNOWN AS THE ^WALK-IN^ DOCUMENT~ IT WAS INTERPRETED BY NOTRA TRULOCK~ THEN CHIEF OF INTEL AT THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT~ AS CONFIRMATION THAT CHINA HAD STOLEN U.S. NUCLEAR SECRETS. BUT THE DOCUMENT ALSO HAD INTEL ABOUT CHINA'S OWN NUCLEAR ARSENAL -- DETAILS OF THE DF-31~ CHINA'S FIRST SOLID-FUELED~ TRUCK-MOUNTED MISSILE. PREVIOUSLY~ U.S. INTEL GATHERING WAS BASED ON EXTERNAL LISTENING AND IMAGING DEVICES. BUT AS CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES INCREASINGLY ENCRYPT THEIR SIGNALS AND USE REDUCED POWER TRANSMISSIONS THAT ARE HARDER TO INTERCEPT DURING TEST SHOTS~ ^MONITORING HAS BECOME A BLACK ART.^ CHINA'S USE OF U.S.-MADE EQUIPMENT PROVIDES US WITH A LOT OF TECHNICAL DATA ABOUT CHINESE COMMUNICATIONS. ^IT'S AN ADVANTAGE FOR EAVESDROPPING~^ SAID A FORMER OFFICER~ NOTING THAT CHINA IS NOT ALLOWED TO OPEN UP THE U.S.-MADE SATELLITES TO SEE WHAT IS INSIDE THEM PRIOR TO A LAUNCH. KERR SAID THE SCIENTIFIC EXCHANGE PROGRAMS SHOULD CONTINUE. KERR SAID THE ^FEEDBACK SYSTEM^ IN WHICH U.S. SCIENTISTS REPORTED ON THEIR TALKS WITH CHINESE COUNTERPARTS HAS BEEN UNEVEN. OFTEN~ ^OUR SCIENTISTS CONSIDERED IT TIRESOME~ INCONVENIENT~ AND A CHORE.^ A 1984 STUDY BY DIA OF CHINESE NUCLEAR WEAPONS SYSTEMS REFLECTS SUCH INFO FROM SCIENTISTS. THE REPORT~ ALSO PREDICTED 15 YEARS AGO THAT CHINESE WEAPONS PROGRAMS WOULD BENEFIT FROM ^OVERT CONTACT WITH U.S. SCIENTISTS^ AS WELL AS FROM ^COVERT ACQUISITION OF U.S. TECHNOLOGY.^ <WP 10/11/99 A2

LEE'S ATTORNEY IN LOS ANGELES~ MARK C. HOLSCHER~ RELEASED A SIX-PAGE DEFENSE OF THE TAIWAN-BORN SCIENTIST.

IT SHOWS THE FORMER LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LAB EMPLOYEE~ WEN HO LEE CHARGED 12/10/99 WITH MISHANDLING NUCLEAR WEAPONS SECRETS--PRECISELY FITS THE BILL FOR THE KIND OF TARGETS TO IMPROVE ITS WEAPONS KNOW-HOW. A COPY OF THIS 361-PAGE BOOK~ CONTAINING DETAILED INFO WAS OBTAINED BY THE FEER. TITLED ^SOURCES AND METHODS OF OBTAINING NATIONAL DEFENSE SCIENCE AND TECH INTEL~^ ITS AUTHORS ARE TWO TOP MILITARY INTEL SPECIALISTS. IT WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN 1991 AND WAS NEVER CLASSIFIED. IT OUTLINES STRATEGIES FOR GATHERING BOTH OPEN AND SECRET MILITARY TECHNOLOGIES FROM ABROAD~ AND HOW THE U.S. IS THE PRIME FOCUS OF THOSE EFFORTS. IT BELIES CHINA'S CLAIM THAT IT USES INDIGENOUS RESEARCH TO DEVELOP MILITARY TECHNOLOGY. THE AUTHORS OF THE BOOK~ ARE TEACHERS OF INTEL AT THE CHINA NATIONAL DEFENSE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INFO CENTER (DSTIC) IN BEIJING. THE CENTER~ COORDINATES TECH INTEL AMONG THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF CHINA'S MILITARY. INTEL IS DEFINED AS ^CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO MAKE BREAKTHROUGHS ON KEY TECHNOLOGIES.^ ABOUT 80% OF THE INTEL NEEDED BY CHINA'S MILITARY CAN BE OBTAINED FROM OPEN SOURCES~ WHILE THE REMAINING 20% MUST BE SOUGHT FROM CLASSIFIED OR SECRET SOURCES. LONG SECTIONS ARE DEVOTED TO LEAKS. AS AN EXAMPLE~ THE BOOK CITES A 1979 LEAK OF KEY DESIGN CONCEPTS OF THE U.S. HYDROGEN BOMB PROGRAM IN A U.S. MAGAZINE~ THE PROGRESSIVE~ TO SHOW HOW ^IMPORTANT REFERENCE MATERIALS^ CAN APPEAR BY MISTAKE. CLASSIFIED MATERIALS~ CAN ALSO BE OBTAINED THROUGH PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS~ BRIBES OR COMPUTER HACKING. BEIJING'S DSTIC WAS SETTING UP A DATABASE OF ^FAMOUS SCIENTISTS^ OVERSEAS~ INCLUDING THEIR HOME ADDRESSES AND ^WHETHER THEY HAVE EVER VISITED CHINA.^ TECH INFO SOURCES IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT~ ARE CONGRESS~ THE DOD~ DOE~ THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADM~ AND THE NATIONAL TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE. ^THIS BOOK CONFIRMS WHAT WE HAVE KNOWN ALL ALONG: THE CHINESE ARE DEDICATED COLLECTORS OF OUR OPEN-SOURCE INFO~^ SAYS JAMES MULVENON~ A CHINA MILITARY SPECIALIST AT THE RAND THINK-TANK IN WASHINGTON. CHINA'S DECISION IN THE EARLY 1980S TO ABANDON ATTEMPTS TO DEVELOP INDIGENOUS MILITARY TECHNOLOGIES IN FAVOR OF A MASSIVE EFFORT TO OBTAIN SUCH TECHNOLOGIES FROM ABROAD. THE KEY FIGURE IN THIS DECISION~ WAS QIAN XUESEN~ A FORMER U.S. ROCKET AND MISSILE SCIENTIST WHO RETURNED TO CHINA IN 1955 AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF SPYING FOR BEIJING. QIAN [WAS INSTRUMENTAL] IN 1983 OF SETTING UP A SYSTEM FOR GATHERING AND ANALYZING OVERSEAS MILITARY TECH INTEL. THE RESULT WAS THE CREATION OF DSTIC. BY 1985~ THE CENTER WAS SUBSCRIBING TO MORE THAN 1~000 FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS AND EMPLOYING HUNDREDS OF STAFF. FAR EAST ECONOMIC REVIEW 12/23/99

IT RAN FROM TWO-BIT PLAYERS -- THE MOLES IN THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION OFFICE PROVIDING DUPLICATE CAR LICENCES~ FOR INSTANCE -- TO THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE SOVIET UNION DEPARTMENT IN WEST GERMAN INTEL. ITS SPREAD AND PENETRATION WERE PARTLY RESULT OF HISTORICAL ACCIDENT -- THE DIFFUSED LOYALTIES AND CONTORTED MORALITY BORN OF A COUNTRY ARTIFICIALLY DIVIDED. BUT THEY WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF GENIUS WITH WHICH WOLF EXPLOITED THESE CONDITIONS. HIS ENEMIES ADMIRED HIM AS MUCH AS THEY HATED AND FEARED HIM. DURING WOLF'S THREE DECADES AT ITS HELM~ EAST GERMANY'S CENTRAL INTEL ADMINISTRATION (HVA) GREW IN POWER AND INFLUENCE~ UNTIL -- IT HAD 2~500 STAFF OFFICERS IN THE MID-1980S. THE EAST GERMAN AGENCY WAS SECOND TO NONE IN ITS DEDICATION AND SKILL. WOLF'S HVA WAS A PRIME SOURCE OF INTEL FOR THE KGB. HIS PERSONAL WARMTH AND CONCERN FOR THOSE WHO WORKED FOR HIM GAINED HIM THEIR UNSHAKABLE LOYALTY AND CREATED A POWERFUL ESPRIT DE CORPS; BUT HE WAS READY TO USE THE SAME HUMAN UNDERSTANDING TO MANIPULATE AND EXPLOIT OTHERS.
