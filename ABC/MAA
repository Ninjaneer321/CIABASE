MATERIALS FROM SUCH COUNTRIES AS IRAN~ IRAQ~ SUDAN AND LIBYA WILL NO LONGER BE PUBLISHED IN WNC AND THAT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED MATERIALS HAVE BEEN DELETED FROM THE DATA BASE. WORLD NEWS CONNECTION (WNC) IS THE DIVISION OF THE US DEPT OF COMMERCE THAT SUCCESSOR TO THE FOREIGN BROADCAST INFO SERVICE (FBIS) FOR DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS ON COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD~ E.G. BROADCASTS OF FULL TEXTS OF SPEECHES~ EDITORIAL COMMENT IN NON-ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS~ AND FACTS THAT NOT IN WESTERN MEDIA BUT CRUCIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING OTHER COUNTRIES. IT IS AVAILABLE (BY SUBSCRIPTION) ON THE WEB AT WNC.FEDWORLD.GOV AND IS WIDELY USED BY SCHOLARS~ JOURNALISTS AND POLICY ANALYSTS EVERYWHERE. MANY UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES PAY A HEFTY SUM FOR IT. THE EMBARGOED COUNTRIES--NOW DELETED--ARE WHERE WNC IS MOST IMPORTANT~ SINCE THEIR POLICY DIFFERENCES WITH THE US OFTEN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO GET ORIGINAL MATERIALS~ ESPECIALLY IN GOOD TRANSLATION. THEY ARE ALSO COUNTRIES THAT TEND TO BE UNDER-REPORTED IN THE WESTERN MEDIA AND ARE IMPORTANT RE POLICY DEVELOPMENTS. BECAUSE OF SANCTIONS~ THE US CANNOT PAY COPYRIGHT FEES...SO~ RATHER THAN RISK A LAW SUIT~ ALL SUCH MATERIAL WILL BE TOSSED IN THE WASTE BASKET. THIS IS MERELY LATEST EROSION OF THIS INVALUABLE SERVICE. IN 1997~ THERE WAS A CONGRESSIONAL ATTEMPT TO SEVERELY CUT FUNDING TO FBIS (WHICH IS STILL THE SOURCE OF MUCH OF THIS MATERIAL). THAT MOVE WAS DEFEATED IN THE FACE OF PUBLIC PROTEST. NOW COMMERCE HAS PROPOSED ELIMINATING NTIS ENTIRELY (SO WNC WOULD VANISH TOTALLY) AND MOVING ITS ARCHIVES TO THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS (WHICH HAS NO DELIVERY MECHANISM). NTIS IS FINANCIALLY SELF-SUPPORTING THROUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS~ WHILE STORAGE OF THE MATERIAL AT THE LOC OR ELSEWHERE WOULD NOT ONLY COST TAXPAYER MONEY BUT WOULD MAKE THE MATERIAL LARGELY UNAVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO HAVE RELIED ON IT FOR YEARS.

MEDIA,IN 1953~ JOSEPH ALSOP~ ONE OF AMERICA'S LEADING SYNDICATED COLUMNISTS~ WENT TO THE PHILIPPINES TO COVER AN ELECTION. HE WENT AT THE REQUEST OF THE CIA. ALSOP IS ONE OF MORE THAN 400 AMERICAN JOURNALISTS WHO IN THE PAST 25 YEARS HAVE SECRETLY CARRIED OUT ASSIGNMENTS FOR CIA. SOME OF THESE JOURNALISTS' RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AGENCY WERE TACIT; SOME WERE EXPLICIT. THERE WAS COOPERATION~ ACCOMMODATION AND OVERLAP. JOURNALISTS PROVIDED A FULL RANGE OF CLANDESTINE SERVICES -- FROM SIMPLE INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING TO SERVING AS GO-BETWEENS WITH SPIES IN COMMUNIST COUNTRIES. REPORTERS SHARED THEIR NOTEBOOKS WITH THE CIA. EDITORS SHARED THEIR STAFFS. SOME OF THE JOURNALISTS WERE PULITZER PRIZE WINNERS~ DISTINGUISHED REPORTERS WHO CONSIDERED THEMSELVES AMBASSADORS WITHOUT PORTFOLIO FOR THEIR COUNTRY. MOST WERE LESS EXALTED: FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS WHO FOUND THAT THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE AGENCY HELPED THEIR WORK; STRINGERS AND FREELANCERS WHO WERE AS INTERESTED IN THE DERRING-DO OF THE SPY BUSINESS AS IN FILING ARTICLES; AND~ THE SMALLEST CATEGORY~ FULL-TIME CIA EMPLOYEES MASQUERADING AS JOURNALISTS ABROAD. IN MANY INSTANCES~ CIA DOCUMENTS SHOW~ JOURNALISTS WERE ENGAGED TO PERFORM TASKS FOR THE CIA WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MANAGEMENTS OF AMERICA'S LEADING NEWS ORGANIZATIONS. USE OF JOURNALISTS HAS BEEN AMONG THE MOST PRODUCTIVE MEANS OF INTEL-GATHERING. ALTHOUGH THE AGENCY HAS CUT BACK SHARPLY ON THE USE OF REPORTERS SINCE 1973 (PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF PRESSURE FROM THE MEDIA)~ SOME JOURNALISTS ARE STILL POSTED ABROAD. INVESTIGATION INTO THE MATTER~ CIA OFFICIALS SAY~ WOULD INEVITABLY REVEAL A SERIES OF EMBARRASSING RELATIONSHIPS IN THE 1950'S AND 1960'S WITH SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS IN AMERICAN JOURNALISM. AMONG EXECUTIVES WHO COOPERATED WERE WILLIAM PALEY OF THE COLUMBIA BROADCASTING SYSTEM~ HENRY LUCE OF TIME INC.~ ARTHUR HAYS SULZBERGER OF THE NEW YORK TIMES~ BARRY BINGHAM SR. OF THE LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL~ AND JAMES COPLEY OF THE COPLEY NEWS SERVICES. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WHICH COOPERATED WITH THE CIA INCLUDE THE AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANY~ THE NATIONAL BROADCASTING COMPANY~ THE ASSOCIATED PRESS~ UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL~ REUTERS~ HEARST NEWSPAPERS~ SCRIPPS-HOWARD~ NEWSWEEK MAGAZINE~ THE MUTUAL BROADCASTING SYSTEM~ MIAMI HERALD AND THE OLD SATURDAY EVENING POST AND NEW YORK HERALD-TRIBUNE.

IN CASE THE COURT EVER TURNED DOWN AN NSA REQUEST~ THE FISA APPEALS COURT WAS CREATED. IT HAS NEVER HEARD A CASE.
