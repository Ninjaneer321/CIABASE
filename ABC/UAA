NSA RELEASES WERE ^JOINED AT THE HIP^ WITH SIMILAR GCHQ RELEASES IN GREAT BRITAIN. THESE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS~ WHICH GIVE A UNIQUE INSIGHT INTO THE FORMER SOVIET ESPIONAGE NETWORK IN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE U.S.~ WERE ALSO RELEASED ON 1 OCTOBER VIA THE INTERNET BY THE PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE~ LONDON. IN ONE DOCUMENT~ KGB ORDERED HAROLD ^KIM^ PHILBY -- CODENAMED ^STANLEY^ -- TO RESTRICT DIRECT CONTACT WITH HIS KGB HANDLER TO ONE MEETING PER MONTH. KIM PHILBY WAS RECRUITED IN 1934~ WORKED FOR MI6 AND WAS ITS LIAISON OFFICER WITH THE CIA AND THE FBI WHILE STATIONED IN WASHINGTON IN THE EARLY 1950S.

DAVID MURPHY WAS CHIEF OF CIA'S BERLIN BASE (BOB)~ DIRECTING OPERATIONS FOCUSED ON THE SOVIET UNION~ EAST GERMANY AND OTHERS. SERGI KONDRASHEV~ WAS FORMER HEAD OF THE GERMAN DEPARTMENT OF THE KGB. IT WAS FASCINATING TO SEE SPELLED OUT DETAILS THAT WERE ONLY WHISPERED ABOUT IN THE COMPARTMENTED~ SECRECY-PROTECTED CIA OF MY TIME.

CIA HAS DECLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS -- PRIMARILY CONTAINING ANALYSIS BY CIA KREMLINOLOGISTS -- TO REFUTE GROWING CRITICISM IT FAILED TO ANTICIPATE FALL OF USSR.

HIS DISAPPEARANCE REMAINS A MYSTERY. HE WAS 32 YEARS OLD AND WITHOUT ANY DIPLOMATIC TRAINING WHEN DISPATCHED TO NAZI-OCCUPIED HUNGARY IN JULY 1944~ TO TAKE ON THE MISSION OF SAVING AS MANY OF BUDAPEST'S REMAINING 200~000 JEWS AS POSSIBLE. HE CREATED THE SCHUTZPASS~ A SWEDISH PROTECTIVE DOCUMENT~ WHICH HE HAD DISTRIBUTED TO THOUSANDS OF JEWS ON DEPORTATION TRAINS OR ON DEATH MARCHES. HE REMARKABLY~ FACED DOWN THE NAZIS TO HELP PREVENT A POGROM IN BUDAPEST'S CENTRAL GHETTO. IT IS ESTIMATED HE SAVED 100~000 JEWS. WHY WAS WALLENBERG ARRESTED ON JAN. 17~ 1945~ AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AFTER HE ENTERED THE INFAMOUS SOVIET GULAG? DURING THE SOVIET ERA~ INQUIRIES WERE MET CONTRADICTORY. THE USSR FIRST ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WAS IN SOVIET HANDS~ THEN DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF HIM~ THEN CLAIMED HE HAD DIED. WHILE WORKING IN THE SWEDISH EMBASSY IN BUDAPEST~ WALLENBERG WAS EMPLOYED BY THE U.S. WAR REFUGEE BOARD~ BELATEDLY ESTABLISHED IN 1944 BY THE ROOSEVELT ADM TO TRY TO SAVE EUROPEAN JEWS.

VIETNAM,VIETNAM@50-99@ VIETNAM'S REVIEW BY WILLIAM E. ODOM THE BLOOD ROAD THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL AND THE VIETNAM WAR BOOK BY JOHN PRADOS WILEY. ^THE BLOOD TRAIL^ CLAIMS THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CUT OFF AND THEREFORE THE WAR COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WON. TRAIL BECOMES JOHN PRADOS'S WINDOW ON THE KEY STRATEGIC DEBATES IN THE JOHNSON AND NIXON ADMS. APPROACH WORKS QUITE WELL FOR THE STORY OF THE STUDIES AND OBSERVATION GROUP~ KNOWN AS MACSOG~ OR JUST SOG~ AND THE SPECIAL FORCES~ OR GREEN BERETS~ AS WELL AS FOR EXPLAINING THEIR ROLES. SOG WAS FORMED IN LATE 1963 WHEN THE U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE COMMAND TOOK OVER CIA-CONTROLLED INDIGENOUS SCOUTS USED TO MONITOR INFILTRATION FROM NORTH VIETNAM. IT GREW RAPIDLY~ ESPECIALLY RE THE SECTION OF THE TRAIL IN LAOS. U.S. SPECIAL FORCES~ IN THE HIGHLANDS OF SOUTH VIETNAM AND NEAR THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE~ AND SOMETIMES SOUTH VIETNAMESE SPECIAL FORCES~ ALSO WORKED AGAINST THE TRAIL. CRUX IS THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THOSE U.S. OFFICIALS WHO WANTED TO TAKE THE WAR NORTH~ PLACING A PERMANENT MILITARY FORCE ASTRIDE THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL~ AND THOSE WHO OPPOSED THE IDEA BECAUSE THEY DOUBTED WHETHER IT COULD BE SUPPORTED AND THEY WORRIED ABOUT CHINESE INTERVENTION. RESULT A ^HALTING AND INCONSISTENT STRATEGY^ BASED ON BOMBING (MORE TONNAGE DROPPED THAN IN ALL OF U.S. STRATEGIC BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II)~ TECHNOLOGY FIXES (E.G.~ THE ^MCNAMARA LINE^) AND SURVEILLANCE AND RAIDS BY SOG- AND GREEN BERET-CONTROLLED FORCES.

UP TO VIETNAM~ I'D ALWAYS BEEN A DON QUIXOTE-LIKE IDEALIST WHO BELIEVED THAT THOSE WHO SERVED AS PROFESSIONAL MILITARY OFFICERS DID SO ONLY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF DUTY~ HONOR~ AND COUNTRY. BUT DURING VIETNAM I FINALLY GOT A LOOK INSIDE THE INNER CIRCLE OF THE ARMY'S TOP BRASS -- AND WITNESSED CORRUPTION AND EVIL SO GREAT IT BROKE MY HEART AND ARC-LIGHTED MY BELIEF SYSTEM. I ALSO DISCOVERED...FEW SENIOR LEADERS UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE WAR OR HAD A CLUE ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBLE MISSION WITH WHICH THEY HAD TASKED THEIR SOLDIERS. MOST GENERALS AND COLONELS WERE THERE ONLY TO GET COMBAT COMMAND ASSIGNMENTS AND THE RIGHT GLORY MEDALS THAT WOULD PUNCH THEIR TICKET....ALL...KNEW THAT IT WAS A BAD~ UNWINNABLE WAR THAT HAD NO MILITARY OBJECTIVE; YET NOT ONE GENERAL [SPOKE] THIS TRUTH. THEY JUST WENT-ALONG-TO-GET-ALONG~ LINING UP OUR YOUNG MEN [TO FILL BODYBAGS]. AFTER...FIVE YEARS~ I TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- WHILE IN UNIFORM AND FROM VIETNAM -- THAT THE WAR WAS NOT WINNABLE~ THEY WERE BEING LIED TO AND WE SHOULD GET OUT NOW. THIS ACT CAUSED A GENERAL WESTMORELAND-LED COUNTER-ATTACK TO DESTROY MY CREDIBILITY. THE GENERALS AND THEIR SYNCHOPHANTS EMPLOYED EVERY DIRTY TRICK IN THEIR SLIMY ATTEMPT TO SILENCE ME (FOR DETAILS~ SEE ABOUT FACE: THE ODYSSEY OF AN AMERICAN WARRIOR~ SIMON & SCHUSTER 1989). THEY HAD TO PROVE THAT I WAS WRONG AND THEY WERE RIGHT~ AND IN SO DOING THEY VIOLATED EVERY PRINCIPLE THAT MAKES AMERICA A FREE LAND.

IT WOULDN'T GO AWAY NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF BAD DREAMS BUT ALSO BECAUSE WESTMORELAND AND HIS FOLLOWERS LAUNCHED A DECEPTIVE CAMPAIGN OF DISINFO TO REWRITE THE WAR. THEY INSISTED THAT WE LOST THE WAR NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR POOR LEADERSHIP~ BUT BECAUSE OF: THE PEACENIKS~ THE COMMIE PRESS AND WEAK-KNEED POLITICIANS. THEY STARTED THE LIE: ^WE WON ALL THE BATTLES~ BUT THEY LOST THE WAR.^ I KNEW THIS WAS A LIE~ AND THIS LIE IS WHAT CAUSED ME TO WRITE ABOUT FACE.... SINCE ABOUT FACE WAS PUBLISHED AND I BEGAN MY NEW CAREER AS A DEFENSE REPORTER...FOR MOST OF THE 2.5 MILLION AMERICANS WHO FOUGHT THERE~ VIETNAM WAS A BAD TRIP. FOR ME~ IT BECAME THE LAUNCHING PAD OF THE JOURNEY I'M STILL ON TODAY -- TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER NOT TO LET THAT SORT OF BLOODBATH HAPPEN AGAIN. DAVID HACKWORTH 1998

VIETNAM,VIETNAM~ @60-00@ MYTH WAS IN 1963 KENNEDY WAS DISILLUSIONED WITH THE VIETNAM WAR AND DECIDED TO WITHDRAW. BUT...IN 1963 KENNEDY SOUGHT TO ESCALATE THE WAR AND SET IN MOTION THE LARGEST COVERT OP IN THE COLD WAR. AT A 1/28/61~ NSC MEETING~ KENNEDY HEARD [THE COMMUNISTS WERE GOING TO WIN]. JFK [ORDERED THE CIA TO GET CRACKING AGAINST NVN]. [DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CIA ACTIONS] HE ISSUED NATIONAL SECURITY ACTION MEMORANDUM 28~ ORDERING IT TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO LAUNCH GUERRILLA OPS INTO NVN. [CIA'S RESPONSE WAS SMALL] BECAUSE COLBY~ WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF CIA OPS IN SAIGON~ BELIEVED THAT A LARGE EFFORT IN THE NORTH WOULD WASTE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR OPS IN THE SOUTH. BY THE END OF 1962~ KENNEDY TURNED THE COVERT WAR OVER TO THE PENTAGON. THERE ARE THREE REASONS FOR HIS DECISION. ONE~ JFK'S COMMITMENT TO PREVENT COMMUNIST DOMINATION OF SVN. TWO~ THE NEED FOR A CONCERTED EFFORT AGAINST NORTH VIETNAM IN COVERT ACTIONS. THREE~ HIS ANGER OVER CIA'S [POOR] COVERT PROGRAM AGAINST THE NORTH. KENNEDY BELIEVED THAT SPECIAL FORCES COULD RAISE THE HEAT ON HANOI. BUT THE JCS WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND RESISTED. TO THWART THE CHIEFS~ MCNAMARA~ BECAME KENNEDY'S ACTION OFFICER FOR THE SECRET WAR. IF JFK WAS IN A HURRY TO STEP UP THE COVERT WAR~ SO WAS MCNAMARA. WALT ROSTOW~ AMONG OTHERS INTERVIEWED~ PUT IT THIS WAY: MCNAMARA STRONGLY BACKED KENNEDY~ WHO WANTED COVERT ACTION OUT OF THE CIA'S HANDS. BECAUSE OF DELAYING TACTICS BY MAXWELL TAYLOR~ CHAIRMAN OF THE JCS~ IT TOOK MOST OF 1963 TO COMPLETE OP PLAN 34A. IT WAS PROVOCATIVE~ AN ELABORATE PROGRAM OF COVERT OPS THE CENTRAL ELEMENT OF WHICH WAS FOSTERING GUERRILLA RESISTANCE MOVEMENTS IN NORTH VIETNAM. IT HAD TAKEN NEARLY THREE YEARS TO PRODUCE THE PLAN JFK WANTED. IT CONTAINED A TOTAL OF 72 CATEGORIES OF ACTIONS~ WHICH~ IF IMPLEMENTED OVER A 12-MONTH PERIOD WOULD PRODUCE A TOTAL 2~062 SEPARATE OPS.

VIETNAM,VIETNAM COMMUNIST LEADERS IN HANOI HAD VERY SENIOR SOUTH VIETNAMESE PEOPLE~ AND SOME SOUTH VIETNAMESE TROOPS~ IN SOUTH VIETNAM FROM 1954. I AM NOT AWARE OF THEIR HAVING NORTH VIETNAMESE LEADERS OR TROOPS THERE IN THE LATE 1950S. IN 1959~ COMMUNIST LEADERS IN HANOI MADE THE DECISION TO SEND SOUTH VIETNAMESE PEOPLE SOUTH. THE US NOTICED IT VERY PROMPTLY. THE FIRST GROUPS OF NORTH VIETNAMESE INFILTRATORS WERE PARCELLED OUT AMONG EXISTING VC UNITS IN THE SOUTH. THIS PUT THEM PROMPTLY INTO COMBAT~ AND THEY SOON STARTED SHOWING UP AMONG THE PRISONERS TAKEN BY ARVN UNITS. SHORTLY AFTERWARD~ NORTH VIETNAMESE BEGAN COMING DOWN IN REGIMENTS~ WHICH REMAINED TOGETHER AS UNITS IN THE SOUTH. THESE WERE NOT NOTICED SO PROMPTLY~ SINCE THE REGIMENTS DID NOT GO QUICKLY INTO COMBAT; THEY FIRST SPENT A FEW MONTHS SETTLING IN AND GETTING TO KNOW THE SITUATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE SOUTH. IT WAS NOT UNTIL WELL INTO 1965 THAT INFORMATION BECAME AVAILABLE FROM POW INTERROGATIONS ABOUT THE REGIMENTS THAT HAD COME SOUTH IN LATE 1964. THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF DOUBT ABOUT IT. NOTHING AS BIG EVEN AS A REGIMENT STARTED SOUTH UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1964~ AND THE FIGHTING BY THOSE TROOPS TOOK PLACE STARTING IN 1965. A STATE DEPARTMENT WHITE PAPER WAS RELEASED IN LATE FEBRUARY 1965. IT DOES INDEED MAKE A USEFUL CHRONOLOGICAL BENCHMARK; ITS FAILURE TO DISCUSS NORTH VIETNAMESE UNITS IN THE SOUTH IS A PRETTY CLEAR INDICATION THAT THE NORTH VIETNAMESE REGIMENTS HAD ARRIVED BY THIS TIME~ HAD NOT GOTTEN INTO ACTUAL COMBAT IN TIME FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES TO BE COVERED IN THE WHITE PAPER. THE WHITE PAPER'S EVIDENCE ON NORTH VIETNAMESE PARTICIPATION IN THE WAR DISCUSSED PLACEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS IN VC UNITS~ AND SUPPLY OF WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION TO VC UNITS. AT THAT TIME POSSIBLY THE US WAS AWARE FROM SIGINT OF THE PRESENCE OF NORTH VIETNAMESE UNITS IN THE SOUTH~ BUT THIS COULD NOT BE DISCUSSED PUBLICLY. THE FIRST PUBLIC US CONFIRMATION OF THE PRESENCE OF A NORTH VIETNAMESE UNIT IN THE SOUTH WAS MADE IN LATE APRIL; THIS SUGGESTS THAT NORTH VIETNAMESE UNITS HAD STARTED PARTICIPATING IN COMBAT~ ALLOWING THE US TO DENOUNCE THEIR PRESENCE WITHOUT COMPROMISING SIGINT.

VIETNAM,VIETNAM~ @20-75@ KEN POST. REVOLUTION~ SOCIALISM AND NATIONALISM IN VIET NAM. BROOKFIELD~ VT: DARTMOUTH PUBLISHING COMPANY (5 VOLUMES): 1989-1994~ REVIEWED BY KIM SCIPES. PROFESSOR KEN POST'S FIVE VOLUME STUDY OF THE VIETNAMESE REVOLUTION IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST A FOCUS ON VIET NAM: IT IS~ ULTIMATELY~ AN EVALUATION OF MARXIST-LENINIST EFFORTS TO CREATE SOCIALISM IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES~ THROUGH AN IN-DEPTH EXAMINATION OF THE VIETNAMESE REVOLUTION UNTIL 1975. IT IS THIS BROADER EVALUATION THAT DEMANDS ATTENTION TO THIS SERIES BY PROGRESSIVES~ MAKING IT OF INTEREST BEYOND THOSE JUST STUDYING VIET NAM~ ALTHOUGH IT IS ESSENTIAL READING FOR THE LATTER. WHILE THIS STUDY IS A VERY SPECIFIC POLITICAL INTERVENTION~ IT IS NOT AN UNCRITICAL EVALUATION. IF ANYTHING~ IT IS AN EXTREMELY CRITICAL (BUT NOT ONE SIDED) ANALYSIS~ WITH POST'S EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF MARXIST-LENINIST THEORY AND HIS DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE RUSSIAN AND CHINESE REVOLUTIONS GIVING ADDITIONAL BREADTH~ DEPTH AND SCOPE TO HIS STUDY. AND THIS IS COMBINED WITH HIS EXTENSIVE RESEARCH IN VIET NAM~ THE UK~ THE NETHERLANDS AND THE UNITED STATES. STUDY FOCUSES DIRECTLY ON TWO KEY ISSUES: (1) ^THE RELATIONS BETWEEN NATIONAL LIBERATION STRUGGLE AND MARXIST-LENINIST SOCIALISM~ AND THEIR PLACE IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS IN THE 20TH CENTURY~^ AND (2) ^WHETHER~ GIVEN THE EXTERNAL PRESSURES AND A HOST OF INTERNAL PROBLEMS~ SOCIALIST SYSTEMS CAN IN FACT BE BUILT IN FORMER COLONIAL COUNTRIES OR OTHERS LIKE THAILAND ... WHICH BECAME DEPENDENTS OF THE CAPITALIST POWERS THOUGH NEVER ACTUALLY ANNEXED.^ HE CONCENTRATES ON VIET NAM TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BECAUSE IT SYMBOLIZES THE SHIFT OF THE WORLD SOCIALIST REVOLUTION SINCE 1917 FROM THE CAPITALIST CENTER TO THE COLONIAL AND SEMI-COLONIAL PERIPHERY AND~ BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY CONFRONTED THE ARMED MIGHT OF THE US~ HE THINKS ITS A MORE IMPORTANT CASE THAN CHINA. POST TAKES AN UNUSUAL TACT IN THAT HE RECOGNIZES THE KEY ROLE OF THE TENETS OF MARXISM-LENINISM IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE VIETNAMESE EXPERIENCE. HE CRITIQUES OTHERS FOR THEIR LACK ON THIS~ NOTING THAT THIS FACT ALONE DISTINGUISHES HIS WORK FROM OTHERS. BUT ANOTHER KEY FACTOR TO HIS APPROACH IS THAT HE TRIES TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS FROM THE INSIDE~ TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS LOOKED TO WORKERS' PARTY LEADERS AS THE STRUGGLE DEVELOPED OVER TIME.

AT THE END OF THE WAR HE ADOPTED A CONSTITUTION SIMILAR TO OURS AND DECLARED INDEPENDENCE. HE DISBANDED THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND CALLED FOR A GENERAL ELECTION WITH ALL PARTIES PARTICIPATING. UNTIL LATE 1945~ THE AMERICANS ON THE SCENE WERE TREATED AS HEROES~ LOVED AND CELEBRATED BY EVERYONE. AT THAT POINT~ WE BETRAYED HIM. WE AND THE BRITISH GAVE INDOCHINA BACK TO THE FRENCH--ALTHOUGH THE LOCAL FRENCH HAD BEEN BRUTAL TO THE INDOCHINESE AND HAD COOPERATED WITH THE JAPANESE DURING THE WAR--AND PUSHED HO NORTH AND BACK INTO COMMUNISM.

THE CIVILIAN IRREGULAR DEFENSE GROUPS (CIDGS) FUNDED BY CIA AND STAFFED IT WITH SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIERS. AFTER WAS GONE THE CIA ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PACIFICATION PROGRAMS. ONE CIA INNOVATION WAS THE STATIC CENSUS GRIEVANCE PROGRAM. THE CIA ESTABLISHED A PROVINCIAL INTERROGATION CENTER IN EACH PROVINCE. THE SPECIAL POLICE STAFFED THE CENTERS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF CIA ADVISERS. CIA'S REVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT CADRE. THE RD CADRES DID NOT ACCOMPLISH MUCH.

VIETNAM,VIETNAM~ @47-75@ ONE OF THE VCI'S FIRST TASKS IN GAINING CONTROL WAS THE RECRUITMENT OF VILLAGERS INTO MASS POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS~ SUCH AS THE LIBERATION FARMER ASSOCIATION~ LIBERATION YOUTH ASSOCIATION~ OR PEOPLE'S COMMITTEE OR INTO THE GUERRILLAS. LIBERATION FARMER ASSOCIATION WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT~ FOR THE PARTY DISTRIBUTED LAND THROUGH IT. MOST OF VCI PERSONNEL CAME FROM THE MASS ORGANIZATIONS. THEY TRIED TO GET MOST OF THE YOUNG MALES TO JOINT THE GUERRILLAS -- A STEPPING STONE TO THE MAIN AND LOCAL FORCES. THE VCI EMPLOYED WOMEN~ CHILDREN AND THE ELDERLY TO CARRY OUT MENIAL TASKS. BETWEEN 1961 THROUGH 1964 THE VC DEPENDED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON RECRUITS FROM THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE RURAL POPULATION. ONLY AT THE END OF 1964 DID THE NORTH VNESE ARMY ENTER SOUTH VIETNAM IN FORCE. THE VCI RECRUITED AND UTILIZED MANY INFORMANTS AND AGENTS IN THE GVN ARMED FORCES~ POLICE~ AND CIVIL SERVICE.

U.S. INVOLVEMENT STARTED IN 1949~ NOT 1960~ WHEN WE SPONSORED FRENCH ATTEMPTS TO REIMPOSE THEIR COLONIAL RULE OVER INDOCHINA. COLBY FORGETS TO MENTION THAT THE CIA CREATED THE DIEM REGIME. AFTER FRENCH DEFEAT AT DIEN BIEN PHU IN EARLY 1954~ CIA PLUCKED NGO DINH DIEM OUT AND ESTABLISHED HIM AS RULER OF SVN. EVEN PRESIDENT EISENHOWER QUESTIONED DIEM'S VIABILITY AND ADMITTED THAT HO CHI MINH COMMANDED LOYALTY OF 80 PERCENT OF ALL VIETNAMESE. USING THE 1954-1955 GENEVA-CONFERENCE-IMPOSED CEASE-FIRE~ THE CIA RAN OPS IN NVN TO SCARE AND LURE THE MINORITY CATHOLIC POPULATION TO MIGRATE SOUTH. ONCE IN SOUTH VIETNAM~ CIA AND THE U.S. MILITARY FORMED THEM INTO AN ARMY~ POLICE FORCE AND GOVT FOR DIEM. CATHOLIC VIETNAMESE NEVER REPRESENTED MORE THAN 10 PERCENT OF SOUTH VIETNAM'S TOTAL POPULATION BUT UNDER DIEM~ A CO-RELIGIONIST~ THEY ENJOYED ALL STATUS AND PRIVILEGES. THE AGENCY ISSUED A SPECIAL NATIONAL INTEL ESTIMATE (SNIE) THAT OMITTED ANY REFERENCE TO IT ROLE IN DIEM'S SUCCESS AND PROCLAIMED DIEM ALONE WAS RESPONSIBLE. FROM 1955 TO 1960 DIEM~ ATTEMPTED TO ASSERT HIS AUTHORITY. HIS MINIONS KILLED~ TORTURED AND IMPRISONED TENS OF THOUSANDS WHO RESISTED.

VIETNAM,VIETNAM~ @60-96@ BOOK~ ROBERT MCNAMARA AND FIVE LIVES OF A LOST WAR~ BY PAUL HENDRICKSON REVIEWED BY JAMES G. HERSHBERG - KNOPF. BOOK IS A DEEPLY INFORMED~ INSIGHTFUL~ PROFOUNDLY AMBIVALENT YET ULTIMATELY PIERCING CHARACTER STUDY~ ONE THAT DOES MUCH TO ELUCIDATE AND EXPOSE ITS ALOOF AND ENDLESSLY CONTRADICTORY CENTRAL FIGURE. IN 1960~ THE NATION -- AND JOHN F. KENNEDY -- ONLY SAW MCNAMARA'S BEST AND BRIGHTEST SIDE: THE ULTRA-COMPETENT~ SUPER-EFFICIENT NEW FORD PRESIDENT WITH A NONCONFORMIST BENT THAT APPEALED TO TALENT SCOUTS RECRUITING GLITTERY ^ACTION INTELLECTUALS^ TO SERVE THE NEW PRESIDENT. WITH JOHNSON VIETNAM BEGAN TO GO SOUR~ AND THE FIGURES STOPPED ADDING UP. THE CORE OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD IS A NUANCED~ DRAMATIC RECOUNTING OF THE 1965-67 PERIOD~ OF MCNAMARA'S INTERNAL STRUGGLES (BOTH WITHIN THE JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION AND WITHIN HIMSELF) OVER VIETNAM POLICY. HERE THE AUTHOR BRINGS ONSTAGE FIVE CHARACTERS WHOSE LIVES WERE FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERED BY THE WAR~ WHO IN EFFECT SERVE AS FOILS TO THE BOOK'S ANTI-HERO~ EACH IN HIS OR HER OWN WAY HAVING TRANSCENDED THE CONSTRICTING SHACKLES OF HISTORY TO ATTAIN A KIND OF GRACE OR RESOLUTION THAT MCNAMARA NEVER ACHIEVED. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE FIVE PERSONS EXAMINED IS NORMAN R. MORRISON~ WHO IMMOLATED HIMSELF IN PROTEST AGAINST THE WIDENING WAR UNDER MCNAMARA'S PENTAGON WINDOW IN THE GATHERING DUSK ON NOVEMBER 2~ 1965. PRECISELY BECAUSE HENDRICKSON'S EMPATHY DOES NOT EXCLUDE SYMPATHY THAT HIS ULTIMATE VERDICT IS SO DAMNING. ADDING UP (AS OTHERS HAVE DONE) THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS KILLED AND WOUNDED DURING MCNAMARA'S PERIOD OF ^VEILED DISBELIEF^ (93~000)~ HENDRICKSON CONDEMNS HIM FOR FAILING TO RESIGN IN PROTEST OR SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY AT A TIME ^WHEN HIS VOICE AND DECISION TO TELL THE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE CHANGED HISTORY AND SAVED THOUSANDS^ -- A LAPSE THE AUTHOR ATTRIBUTES TO A FATAL MIXTURE OF AMBITION~ POWER-CRAVING AND A MORAL FAILURE OF NERVE~ ALL ADDING UP TO A ^TRAGIC FLAW OF CHARACTER.^ MCNAMARA~ HENDRICKSON CONCLUDES~ ^WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY IMPRESSIVE PERSON~ ALMOST A NEW ADAM~ WHO ABUSED HIS TRUST~ AND KNOWS HE DID~ AND SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE PAYING FOR IT.^ <WPBW 9/15/96 1~10

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT~ ARMY AND CIA LAWYERS OPPOSING REQUEST HAVE CALLED THE DOCUMENTS IRRELEVANT. THEY ARGUED THE GVT COULD REJECT PLEA FOR BACK PAY BECAUSE SECRET CONTRACTS FOR COVERT OPS WERE UNENFORCEABLE.

THIRD TASK WAS OFTEN CARRIED OUT BY CIA-LED VNESE ORGANIZED INTO PROVINCIAL RECONNAISSANCE UNITS (PRU). ORIGINAL CONCEPT WAS QUICKLY DILUTE~ FOR TWO MAIN REASONS: (1) PRESSURE FORM THE TOP TO FILL NUMERICAL QUOTAS OF PERSON TO BE NEUTRALIZED; (2) DIFFICULTIES AT THE BOTTOM OF IDENTIFYING NLF CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE.

SNEPP~ WHO SERVED AS AN ANALYST IN SAIGON~ BETRAYED NO NAMES~ NO OPS...IT WAS HIS FINEST MOMENT. NOW~ SNEPP GIVES US IN ^IRREPARABLE HARM~^ DETAILS OF HIS LOST [LEGAL] BATTLE. SNEPP'S MAIN REVELATION IN ^DECENT INTERVAL^ WAS THAT THE CIA HAD BETRAYED THOUSANDS OF ITS EMPLOYEES AND COLLABORATORS IN SOUTH VIETNAM BY FAILING TO EVACUATE THEM BEFORE THE NORTH VIETNAMESE ONSLAUGHT THAT ENDED THE WAR IN MAY 1975. SNEPP'S LAST DAYS AS RECOUNTED IN ^IRREPARABLE HARM~^ AREN'T MUCH FUN TO READ. IN SNEPP'S VERSION~ GUYS LIKE HIM TELL THEIR STORY TO GUYS LIKE ME~ GET THEIR 15 MINUTES OF FAME~ A FEW TV APPEARANCES~ MAYBE A BOOK CONTRACT AND THEN SLOWLY RECEDE INTO OBLIVION. MARCHETTI GAVE SNEPP THE MOST ACCURATE AND DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WAS TO COME. MARCHETTI ^EMBRACED ME HARD. `FROM NOW ON~' HE SAID~ `YOU'RE GONNA BE AN OUTLAW~ A GUNSLINGER ALL BY YOURSELF. AND EVERY TIME YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET THERE'S GONNA BE SOMEBODY WAITIN' TO TAKE A SHOT AT YOU.'^ SNEPP'S DEVIOUSNESS NOT ONLY ENERGIZED THE CIA BUT THE FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM. MUCH OF ^IRREPARABLE HARM^ DEPICTS SNEPP'S SAD RIDE FROM A BIZARRE TRIAL BEFORE A BIASED FEDERAL JUDGE IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA~ TO THE 4TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS IN RICHMOND AND FINALLY TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE ACCOUNT IS MUST READING FOR EVERY LAW STUDENT IN AMERICA~ AND FOR EVERY BURGEONING NIHILIST. EACH COURT FOCUSED ON SNEPP'S DECEIT~ AND IGNORED THE LAW--THAT IS~ THE FACT THAT AT THE TIME~ THERE WAS NO STATUTE THAT GAVE THE U.S. GOVT THE RIGHT TO REVIEW SNEPP'S FUTURE WORK IN ADVANCE~ IF INTEL SECRETS WERE NOT AT RISK. SNEPP'S WORST MOMENT CAME IN FEBRUARY~ 1980~ WHEN THE SUPREME COURT~ CITING ^SNEPP'S UNFAITHLESSNESS~^ UPHELD THE LOWER COURT RULINGS BY A VOTE OF 6 TO 3~ WITHOUT ANY ORAL ARGUMENTS OR A FULL BRIEFING ON THE ISSUES. THE COURT~ OBVIOUSLY ENERGIZED BY A VISCERAL DISLIKE OF SNEPP'S TACTICS~ DECLARED THAT ^WITHOUT A DEPENDABLE PREPUBLICATION PROCEDURE~ NO INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OR RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL COULD BE ASSURED THAT AN EMPLOYEE PRIVY TO SENSITIVE INFORMATION MIGHT NOT CONCLUDE ON HIS OWN--INNOCENTLY OR OTHERWISE--THAT IT SHOULD BE DISCLOSED TO THE WORLD.^ THE SNEPP CASE HAD NOW BEEN EXPANDED~ BY COURT DICTA~ TO ALL RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
