THIS ISN'T SURPRISING GIVEN THE CIA HAS PROVIDED COVERT SUPPORT OF PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENTS IN CHINA SINCE THE LATE 1980'S~ AND SINCE IT HAS A COVERT ASSISTANCE NETWORK IN PLACE. CHINA'S STATE SECURITY AND PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTRIES~ HAVE MADE IT A PRIORITY TO UNCOVER CIA'S OPS IN CHINA AND HAVE UNCOVERED EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT SEPARATISTS HAVE HAD CONTACTS WITH THE CIA~ ALTHOUGH CHINA HAS DOUBTS ABOUT EXTENT OF CIA'S INVOLVEMENT TODAY. BEIJING HAS REFRAINED FROM PUBLICLY ACCUSING CIA~ WHILE MAINTAINING USUAL LINE OF BLAMING SEPARATISTS AND ^FOREIGN FORCES HOSTILE TO CHINA^ FOR A SERIES OF BOMB ATTACKS IN THE FAR-WESTERN REGION AND IN BEIJING IN THE RECENT PAST.

KADEER'S ARREST HIGHLIGHTS THE FAILURE OF THE GOVT TO PERSUADE ELITE MEMBERS OF THE MUSLIM MINORITY TO ACCEPT FEDERAL AUTHORITY IN A PROVINCE FAR FROM BEIJING. IN RECENT YEARS~ UIGHUR SEPARATISTS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT STATE CALLED EAST TURKESTAN~ BORDERING THREE FORMER CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS~ RUSSIA AND MONGOLIA. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHINESE SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED IN THE REGION TO CRUSH THE SEPARATIST MOVEMENT~ WHICH DIFFERS FROM THE CAMPAIGN FOR A SEPARATE STATE IN TIBET~ JUST SOUTH OF XINJIANG. THE UIGHURS~ HAVE USED VIOLENCE~ KILLING POLICE OFFICERS AND CHINESE SETTLERS AND BOMBING BUSES AS FAR AWAY AS BEIJING. BUT THEIR MOVEMENT IS NOT AS ORGANIZED AS THE TIBETAN CAMPAIGN--WHICH IS LED BY THE DALAI LAMA~ BASED IN THE MOUNTAINS OF NORTHERN INDIA. FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN THE MID-1990S~ KADEER WAS LIONIZED AS A POOR UIGHUR WHO HAD ADVANCED THROUGH HARD WORK AND THE HELP OF A BENEVOLENT GOVERNMENT. SHE GAINED PROMINENCE FOR ENCOURAGING UIGHUR WOMEN TO START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES. FROM 1993 TO 1998~ SHE SERVED AS AN ELECTED MEMBER OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE'S POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE. BUT IN MARCH 1998 WANG LEQUAN~ THE VICE GOVERNOR OF XINJIANG~ ADVISED THAT REBIYA WAS NOT REELECTED BECAUSE SHE HAD ^FAILED TO EXPLICITLY EXPRESS HER OPPOSITION TO^ HER HUSBAND'S ANTI-CHINESE BROADCASTS.^ CHINESE AUTHORITIES CRITICIZED HER FOR ALLOWING HER SONS TO LEAVE CHINA AND JOIN HER HUSBAND IN THE UNITED STATES. <WP 9/7/99 A20

BUT THERE IS A RECENT ESCALATION BY SEPARATIST GROUPS~ SUPPORTED BY MILITANT ISLAMIC GROUPS~ SUCH AS THE TALEBAN. CAMPAIGN IS RESISTED BY THE CHINESE. FOR THEM XINJIANG~ WHICH IS ALMOST THE SIZE OF TEXAS~ IS OF CRUCIAL STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE. PROVINCE'S SIGNIFICANCE STEMS FROM ITS SHARED BORDERS WITH KAZAKHSTAN~ KYRGYZSTAN~ TAJIKI-STAN AND A SLIVER OF AFGHANISTAN~ AS WELL AS INDIA~ RUSSIA AND MONGOLIA. TO COUNTER THEM~ CHINA HAS SPENT BILLIONS. IT HAS SHIFTED MILLIONS OF ITS INLAND POOR TO THE PROVINCE TO STRENGTHEN CHINA'S CONTROL. INFLUX OF WORKERS FROM CHINA FOLLOWED DISCOVERY IN 1989 OF VAST OIL RESERVES IN THE TAKLAMAKAN DESERT. AS A RESULT OF MIGRATION~ THE MUSLIMS NOW MAKE UP 58 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION~ DOWN FROM MORE THAN 80 PER CENT 50 YEARS AGO. RESENTMENT AMONG NON-CHINESE~ THE UIGHURS~ HAS SWELLED AS THEY FIND THEMSELVES INCREASINGLY MARGINALIZED. ALTHOUGH NO GOVT CAN RISK OFFENDING CHINA BY HELPING ITS OPPONENTS TO ORGANIZE OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS~ SOME FACTIONS HAVE ESTABLISHED CAMPS IN MOUNTAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA AND ARE DIRECTING OPS INSIDE THE CHINESE BORDER. ^THEY HAVE THEIR OWN GOVT-IN-EXILE AND~ THERE ARE MILITARY CAMPS~^ SAID CHRIS LEUNG~ AN AMERICAN RESEARCHER WHO SPENT TIME WITH UIGHUR SEPARATISTS IN UZBEKISTAN AND TURKEY. <WT 1/2/99 A7

SEVERAL AMERICANS IN CIA OPS OR CLOSE TO THEM SAID TO THE MAKERS OF MORAL COMBAT~ A BBC2 DOCUMENTARY~ AND TO THE SUNDAY TIMES ABOUT THEIR ROLES. WALKER SAID HE HAD NOT WANTED WAR IN KOSOVO~ BUT ADMITTED CIA WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY INVOLVED IN THE COUNTDOWN TO AIRSTRIKES.

THE KOSOVO LIBERATION ARMY'S WAR KLA AGAINST THE SERB-CONTROLLED GOVT OF YUGOSLAVIA. NATO MAINTAINS ITS DISTANCE FROM THE KLA. BUT THE KLA HAS EMERGED IN RECENT WEEKS AS THE SOLE LEGITIMATE POLITICAL FORCE REPRESENTING THE PROVINCE'S 1.6 MILLION ETHNIC ALBANIANS. KLA HAS SHOWN GLIMPSES OF MANY FACES IN ITS SEVEN YEARS OF EXISTENCE. THE KLA HAS SCORED AN IMPORTANT POLITICAL VICTORY: THIS ILL-ORGANIZED~ POORLY ARMED GROUP OF STUDENTS~ PEASANTS AND FORMER POLITICAL PRISONERS HAS FORCED ITS INSURGENCY TO THE TOP OF THE INTERNATIONAL AGENDA. BUT THE KLA WILL BE CENTRAL TO ITS FINAL OUTCOME. SKIRMISHING BEGAN IN DECEMBER AND INTENSIFIED IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY. KLA OFFICIALS HAVE COMPLAINED OF BEING CHRONICALLY SHORT OF AMMUNITION. A KEY PART OF THE YUGOSLAVIA'S STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO DRIVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CIVILIANS OUT OF THEIR HOMES~ REMOVING ANY BASE OF CIVILIAN SUPPORT FOR THE REBELS AND CREATING AN IMMENSE LOGISTICAL DISTRACTION. NEARLY 8~000 NEW RECRUITS~ INCLUDING ALBANIAN-AMERICANS~ HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO TRAINING CAMPS IN NORTHERN ALBANIA. THE KLA WAS FOUNDED IN 1992 AS A RADICAL MOVEMENT BORN IN RESPONSE TO RADICAL SERBIAN NATIONALISM. IN 1989~ YUGOSLAV PRESIDENT SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC PROVINCE'S NEAR-MYTHICAL STATUS AMONG SERBS AS A REPOSITORY OF SERBIAN NATIONALISM~ HAD STRIPPED KOSOVO OF ITS AUTONOMY. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF KOSOVAR ALBANIANS WERE TOSSED OUT OF THEIR JOBS. HUNDREDS OF INTELLECTUALS~ HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS AND POLITICAL ACTIVISTS WERE IMPRISONED. THE DEATH KNELL FOR PEACEFUL PROTEST WAS THE END OF THE BOSNIAN WAR IN 1995 AND THE DAYTON AGREEMENT~ WHICH IGNORED THE CLAIMS OF KOSOVO'S ALBANIANS FOR A RESTORATION OF THEIR POLITICAL RIGHTS.

PROMOTION-HUNGRY OPERATIVES COLLECT POINTLESS INTEL FROM WORTHLESS AGENTS - REFORM MAY PROVE IMPOSSIBLE. NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF THE CASE OFFICERS FROM 1985 JUNIOR-CLASS HAVE QUIT. THERE A SEVERE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN REPUTATIONS OF MOST SENIOR OFFICERS AND THEIR TALENTS. AUTHOR WHO WORKED IN THE DIRECTORATE OF OPERATIONS (DO) NEAR EAST DIVISION CLAIMS THE DO EVOLVED INTO A SORRY BLEND OF MONTY PYTHON AND BIG BROTHER. IT LIES TO ITSELF AS IT LIES TO OUTSIDERS. BY 1985~ MOST AGENTS WERE MEDIOCRE AT BEST~ HIRED BECAUSE CASE OFFICERS NEEDED HIGH RECRUITMENT NUMBERS TO GET PROMOTED. DISCUSSES COLD RECRUITMENTS OF SOVIETS DURING THE COLD WAR. IN 50S AND 60S CIA LEADERS WERE DEVOTED TO COVERT ACTION. BY 1977~ TUG-OF-WAR BETWEEN COVERT ACTION AND ESPIONAGE WAS OVER. IN THE LATE 60S AND EARLY 70S RECRUITING AGENTS BECAME CASE OFFICERS' IMPERATIVE. VIETNAM WAR'S CORROSIVE EFFECT: A SURPLUS OF EASILY RECRUITED ^SOURCES^; POOR INTEL QUALITY CONTROL; AND FALLING ADMISSION STANDARDS. SOUTHEAST ASIA BECAME A LIAR'S PARADISE~ WHERE AGGRESSIVE~ SELF-PROMOTING OFFICERS QUICKLY GOT AHEAD. EASY RECRUITMENTS IN THE THIRD WORLD OF ^ACCESS AGENTS~^ TO SOVIET TARGETS. BY 1993~ THE DO USED ^ASSET VALIDATION SYSTEM~^ TO PREVENT RECRUITMENT OF DOUBLE AGENTS AND COLD WAR LEFTOVERS. THIS INCREASED DECEITS. ^AGENT SCRUBBING^ HAS NOT AFFECTED THE GAME. PROBLEMS IN THE DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE (DI) DISCUSSED.

VERY CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT REALITIES AND BIG-PICTURE SCENARIOS ESCAPE THEM.

KENNEDY'S AIDE O'DONNELL RECALLS WHAT KENNEDY TOLD SENATOR MANSFIELD - A CRITIC OF THE WAR. PRESIDENT TOLD MANSFIELD HE NOW AGREED ON THE NEED FOR A COMPLETE MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM VN. ^BUT I CAN'T DO IT UNTIL 1965 - AFTER I'M REELECTED.^ IF HE ANNOUNCED IT BEFORE THE ELECTION THERE WOULD BE A WILD CONSERVATIVE OUTCRY. IN 75 MANSFIELD CONFIRMED STORY TO JACK ANDERSON~ SAYING THAT KENNEDY HAD ^DEFINITELY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY^ MADE THE DECISION~ AND THAT WITHDRAWAL WOULD BE GRADUAL. IN 78 MANSFIELD PROVIDED MORE DETAILS: KENNEDY TOLD ME HE WANTED TO BEGIN WITHDRAWING TROOPS THE FIRST OF 1964. KENNEDY CONFIDED IN MCNAMARA~ MANSFIELD AND O'DONNELL~ BUT NOT HIS SECRETARY OF STATE.

HE SAID THE WAR COULD NOT BE WON WITHIN TWO YEARS AND THAT THERE WERE PROS AND CONS TO VIETNAMIZATION. THE MORE TROOPS ARE WITHDRAWN~ THE MORE (NORTH VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS IN) WILL BE ENCOURAGED. THEY ARE THE LAST PEOPLE WE WILL BE ABLE TO FOOL ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE TO TAKE OVER FROM US. A MEMO BY FRANK GANNON~ A WHITE HOUSE AIDE~ SAID HE WAS VERY DISTURBED BY PLANS TO AID NORTH VIETNAM IN REBUILDING ITS WAR-SHATTERED ECONOMY AFTER THE WAR. AT THE CABINET MEETING IT WAS SAID THAT WE CAN'T MAKE IT LOOK LIKE WE FOUGHT THIS WAR JUST TO GET OUR POWS BACK. I THINK THIS IS AN ARGUMENT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD ACCEPT AND UNDERSTAND. THE BEST REASON FOR ENDING THE WAR~ GANNON WROTE~ IS ONE I PRESUME WE CAN'T USE: IS TO GET THE COMMIES BY THE ECONOMIC SHORT HAIRS SO THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD STARTING ANOTHER WAR. GANNON SUGGESTED THAT NEITHER NIXON NOR KISSINGER COULD SAY THAT~ BUT THAT THE MESSAGE COULD BE CONVEYED INDIRECTLY THROUGH SOME OF THE SPOKESMEN. AP 3/19/98

THE PLAN~ WHICH WOULD BE THE FIFTH COVERT ATTEMPT BY THE CIA TO GET RID OF THE IRAQI PRESIDENT~ MUST BE APPROVED BY PRESIDENT CLINTON. DCI TENET TOLD CLINTON THE PLAN IS RISKY~ AND NSC ADVISER BERGER DOUBTS THE AGENCY'S ABILITY TO UNDERMINE HUSSEIN. PLAN WOULD TRY TO WEAKEN THE IRAQI LEADER BY DAMAGING THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY. IT WOULD TARGET FOR DESTRUCTION UTILITY PLANTS AND GOVERNMENT BROADCAST STATIONS~ AND INCREASE POLITICAL PRESSURE THROUGH PROPAGANDA PROGRAMS LIKE A ``RADIO FREE IRAQ'' BROADCAST TO BAGHDAD. ``THIS IS NOT A PROPAGANDA OPERATION~ ^THIS IS A MAJOR CAMPAIGN OF SABOTAGE. ''IF APPROVED~ THE PLAN COULD COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND BECOME ONE OF THE LARGEST COVERT OPS SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR. SINCE 1991~ CIA HAS BACKED KURDISH DISSIDENTS IN NORTHERN IRAQ~ SHIITE MUSLIMS IN THE SOUTH AND IRAQI EXILES AND DEFECTORS IN LONDON AND JORDAN IN AN UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO DESTABILIZE HUSSEIN. AP 02/26/98
POLITICAL A,IRAQ~ @98@ IRAQ'S OPPOSITION EXPRESSED CONCERN PRESIDENT CLINTON'S RECENT PLEDGE TO GIVE MORE SUPPORT TO THEIR CAUSE HAS NOT INCREASED THEIR ROLE. CLINTON PROMISED TO SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION AND IMPLEMENT THE IRAQI LIBERATION ACT~ A NEW LAW AUTHORIZING $97 MILLION IN U.S. MILITARY AID TO OPPOSITION FORCES. MOST EXILED IRAQIS ARE UNDER THE IRAQI NATIONAL CONGRESS~ HEADED BY AHMED CHALABI AND BASED IN LONDON. WITHIN IRAQ~ TWO KURDISH MILITIAS CONTROL TERRITORY~ SHIELDED BY U.S. NO-FLY ZONES. ONE GROUP IS LOCATED IN A OPPOSITION TO IRAQI PRESIDENT SADDAM ARE: IRAQI NATIONAL CONGRESS~ FOUNDED IN 1992 AS AN ANTI-SADDAM UMBRELLA GROUP; ORIGINALLY TO UNITE KURDISH FACTIONS. FORMERLY THE PRINCIPAL U.S. AID CLIENT~ IT WAS PRACTICALLY WIPED OUT. IT NOW OPERATES FROM LONDON AND IS HEADED BY AHMED CHALABI. IRAQI NATIONAL ACCORD RECEIVED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE U.S.~ SAUDI ARABIA~ KUWAIT AND BRITAIN. OPENED OFFICE IN AMMAN~ JORDAN~ IN 1996 AND STARTED A RADIO STATION. LEADER IS AYAD ALAWI. SUPREME COUNCIL FOR ISLAMIC REVOLUTION IN IRAQ~ HQS IN TEHRAN. SHIITE MUSLIMS THE ONLY GROUP OF DISSIDENTS FIGHTING; IRAN SUPPORTS IT. KURDISTAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LED BY MASSOUD BARZANI; JOINED WITH BAGHDAD TO DEFEAT KURDISH RIVALS~ THE IRAQI NATIONAL CONGRESS~ IN 1996. PATRIOTIC UNION OF KURDISTAN LED BY JALAL TALABANI. EARLIER THIS YEAR~ TALABANI SENT ENVOYS TO BAGHDAD TO MAKE PEACE WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN. MOVEMENT FOR CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY LED BY SHARIF HUSSEIN~ A MEMBER OF IRAQ'S FORMER ROYAL FAMILY. <WP 12/18/98 A57
POLITICAL A,IRAQ~ @98@ PER THE STATE DEPT THE U.S. WORKING WITH 73 GROUPS OUTSIDE IRAQ~ PLANS A NEW EFFORT FUNDED BY CONGRESS TO BUILD UP POLITICAL OPPOSITION TO SADDAM. CONGRESS APPROVED $5 MILLION TO FUND RADIO FREE IRAQ. REPUBLICANS ALSO PROPOSED SPENDING ANOTHER $33 MILLION TO HELP IRAQI OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS OVERTHROW THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT AND PROVIDE THEM HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. STATE EXPECTS TO RECEIVE $5 MILLION OF THAT AMOUNT. REUTERS 6/18/98
POLITICAL A,IRAQ~ @98@ SECRETARY OF STATE ALBRIGHT'S REMARKS IN NEWSWEEK RE A PLAN FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE IRAQI LEADER THAT WAS PUT FORWARD BY A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF FORMER U.S. FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY OFFICIALS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CLINTON'S THREAT TO BOMB IRAQ. THEIR PLAN CALLS FOR PROVIDING ARMS AND MILITARY AIR SUPPORT TO RESTORE A SAFE HAVEN IN NORTHERN IRAQ AND GIVE DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION TO A GROUP OF IRAQI EXILES SO THAT THEY CAN USE IT AS A BASE TO REMOVE SADDAM HUSSEIN FROM POWER. NSC ADVISER BERGER DREW AN ANALOGY TO THE BAY OF PIGS LAST WEEK IN ANSWERING WHY THE U.S. IS NOT RELEASING FROZEN IRAQI FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE EXILE GROUPS. ^IF YOU ENCOURAGE AND ALMOST INCITE PEOPLE TO RISE UP AGAINST THEIR GOVERNMENT~ YOU INCUR A MORAL OBLIGATION~^ NOTING THE U.S. EXPERIENCES IN CUBA IN 1961~ HUNGARY IN 1956 AND IRAQ IN 1991~ AT THE END OF OPERATION DESERT STORM. LAST WEEK'S PROPOSAL CALLED FOR THE IRAQI PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF THE IRAQI NATIONAL CONGRESS (INC).^ THE INC~ WHICH IS LED BY AHMED CHALABI~ HAS MEMBERSHIP FROM DISPARATE KURDISH~ SUNNI AND SHIITE MUSLIM GROUPS AND IN THE PAST [WAS SUPPORTED BY THE U.S.]. IN THE BAY OF PIGS FIASCO~ THE IG REPORT CRITICIZED CIA PLANNERS FOR BELIEVING THAT 30~000 CUBANS WOULD JOIN THE GUERRILLAS IN FIGHTING CASTRO. ^WE CAN CONFIDENTLY ASSERT~^ THE REPORT SAID~ ^THAT THE AGENCY HAD NO EVIDENCE THAT CUBANS IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS COULD OR WOULD JOIN THE INVADERS.^ <WP 2/23/98 A14
POLITICAL A,IRAQ~ @98@ THE ADM HAS A DETAILED~ 27-PAGE PLAN TO REBUILD IRAQ'S POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND PREPARE FOR A POSSIBLE WAR CRIMES INDICTMENT OF IRAQI LEADERS. PLAN CALLS FOR $5 MILLION~ TO TRAIN OPPOSITION GROUPS IN ORGANIZING AND RECRUITMENT TECHNIQUES~ TO FUND A CENTER FOR EXILE ACTIVITIES IN LONDON AND TRANSLATE AND INDEX MILLIONS OF CAPTURED IRAQI DOCUMENTS FOR POSSIBLE USE AS EVIDENCE IN A WAR CRIMES PROSECUTION. ANOTHER $5 MILLION HAS BEEN USED TO ESTABLISH AN ANTI-SADDAM ^RADIO FREE IRAQ~^ RUN BY RADIO FREE EUROPE/RADIO LIBERTY IN PRAGUE. THE ADM HAS INVITED THE TWO LEADERS OF RIVAL KURDISH FACTIONS IN NORTHERN IRAQ -- MASUD BARZANI OF THE KURDISH DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND JALAL TALABANI OF THE POPULAR UNION OF KURDISTAN -- TO VISIT LATER THIS YEAR. BOTH ARE DAMAGED GOODS POLITICALLY: BARZANI BECAUSE HE ALLIED HIS FORCES WITH SADDAM'S ARMY DURING HIS 1996 CONFLICT WITH TALABANI IN AN OP THAT LED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF A CIA-BACKED MOVEMENT INSIDE IRAQ; AND TALABANI BECAUSE HE ACCEPTED SUPPORT FROM IRAN IN THAT CONFLICT. THE LIST OF 73 IRAQI OPPOSITION GROUPS IS ^ABSURD [BECAUSE] MANY OF THE GROUPS LISTED NUMBER ONLY ONE PERSON AND SEVERAL ARE NOT EVEN IRAQI.^ GOP LAWMAKERS ASKED INDYK TO REDIRECT SOME OF THE $5 MILLION TO A LONDON-BASED GROUP CALLED INDICT~ WHICH IS PROMOTING WAR CRIMES PROSECUTION OF THE IRAQI LEADERSHIP. GOP SENATORS ARE ALSO UNHAPPY BECAUSE THEY WANT MOST MONEY TO GO TO THE IRAQI NATIONAL CONGRESS~ A LONDON-BASED UMBRELLA GROUP THAT UNTIL SHATTERED BY BARZANI'S PLOY IN 1996 WAS RECOGNIZED AS THE VOICE OF THE IRAQI OPPOSITION. THE PLAN PROVIDES $125~000 FOR ^COORDINATION^ OF THE ACTIVITIES OF GROUPS PURSUING THE WAR CRIMES ISSUE AND $375~000 FOR DOCUMENT TRANSLATION. BUT MUCH OF THE PLAN READS LIKE A MANUAL FOR GRASS-ROOTS ACTIVISTS: ^GROUP LEADERS WILL BE INVITED TO A SERIES OF SEMINARS BY ORGANIZATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS.... TRAINING SESSIONS WILL BE HELD FOR WORKING-LEVEL MEMBERS ON OFFICE ADMINISTRATION~ FUND-RAISING~ GRANT PROPOSAL WRITING~ ACCOUNTING~ DATA PROCESSING~ INTRA- AND INTERGROUP COMMUNICATIONS~ DESKTOP PUBLISHING~ WEB/INTERNET USAGE~ MEDIA RELATIONS AND RELATED TOPICS.^ <WP 8/2/98 A1
