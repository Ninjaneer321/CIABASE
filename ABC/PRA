NOW EXPERTS WONDER WHETHER SUCH COMPARTMENTALIZATION HAS GONE TOO FAR. HIGHLY SENSITIVE INTEL IS SO COMPARTMENTALIZED~ RUMSFELD SAID~ THAT WRONG INFO IS SOMETIMES GIVEN POLICYMAKERS BECAUSE ANALYSTS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CORRECT SECRET DATA.

ENDING WAS ALTERED IN THE 1955 ANIMATED VERSION~ WHICH REMOVED THE HUMANS - FILM'S SECRET PRODUCER WAS THE CIA. IT WORRIED THE PUBLIC MIGHT BE TOO INFLUENCED BY ORWELL'S POX-ON-BOTH-THEIR-HOUSES CRITIQUE OF THE CAPITALIST HUMANS AND COMMUNIST PIGS. SO AFTER HIS DEATH IN 1950~ CIA'S E. HOWARD HUNT~ BOUGHT THE FILM RIGHTS FROM HIS WIDOW TO MAKE ITS MESSAGE MORE OVERTLY ANTI-COMMUNIST. THE BOOK~ THE CULTURAL COLD WAR: THE CIA AND THE WORLD OF ARTS AND LETTERS (THE NEW PRESS) BY FRANCES STONOR SAUNDERS~ A BRITISH JOURNALIST CONTAINS MORE. BY COMBING THROUGH ARCHIVES AND UNPUBLISHED MANUSCRIPTS AND INTERVIEWING PRINCIPAL ACTORS~ SAUNDERS HAS UNCOVERED NEW DETAILS OF THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1947 AND 1967.

IN ONE MEMORABLE EPISODE~ THE BRITISH FOREIGN OFFICE SUBSIDIZED THE DISTRIBUTION OF 50~000 COPIES OF DARKNESS AT NOON~ ARTHUR KOESTLER'S ANTI-COMMUNIST CLASSIC. BUT THE FRENCH COMMUNIST PARTY ORDERED ITS OPERATIVES TO BUY UP EVERY COPY OF THE BOOK. KOESTLER RECEIVED A WINDFALL IN ROYALTIES. INSTEAD OF ILLUSTRATING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS BY TAKING THE HIGH ROAD~ THE AGENCY JUSTIFIED ITS COVERT ACTS BY REFERRING TO THE UNETHICAL TACTICS OF THE SOVIETS. THE CULTURAL COLD WAR BEGAN IN POSTWAR EUROPE WITH THE FRAYING OF THE WARTIME ALLIANCE BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW. OFFICIALS IN THE WEST BELIEVED THEY HAD TO COUNTER SOVIET PROPAGANDA AND UNDERMINE THE WIDE SYMPATHY FOR COMMUNISM IN FRANCE AND ITALY. AN ODD ALLIANCE WAS STRUCK BETWEEN THE CIA LEADERS~ MOST OF THEM WEALTHY IVY LEAGUE VETS OF OSS~ AND A CORPS OF LARGELY JEWISH EX-COMMUNISTS WHO HAD BROKEN WITH MOSCOW TO BECOME VIRULENTLY ANTI-COMMUNIST. CIA KNEW IT COULD NOT OPENLY SPONSOR ARTISTS AND INTELLECTUALS IN EUROPE BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH ANTI-AMERICAN FEELING THERE. IT DECIDED TO WOO INTELLECTUALS OUT OF THE SOVIET ORBIT BY SECRETLY PROMOTING A NON-COMMUNIST LEFT OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS WITH MOSCOW. SAUNDERS DESCRIBES HOW THE CIA SKIMMED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE MARSHALL PLAN TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES. ^WE COULDN'T SPEND IT ALL~^ GILBERT GREENWAY~ A FORMER CIA AGENT~ RECALLED. ^THERE WERE NO LIMITS~ AND NOBODY HAD TO ACCOUNT FOR IT.

PROPAGANDA,CHINA @94-96@ PUBLICITY RE ARREST IN CHINA LAST SUMMER ENDOWED HARRY WU WITH STATUS. HE NOW APPEARS EVERYWHERE TO DISRUPT AND DISTURB AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY ON CHINA. WU IN 4/96 CANCELLED AN APPEARANCE AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION IN GENEVA. HARRY WU'S USES DECEIT. WU IS CAPABLE OF DOING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO PUBLIC INTEREST RE U.S. POLICY TOWARD CHINA. IN A 2/96 PLAYBOY INTERVIEW HE SAID~ ^I VIDEOTAPED A PRISONER WHOSE KIDNEYS WERE SURGICALLY REMOVED WHILE HE WAS ALIVE~ AND THEN THE PRISONER WAS TAKEN OUT AND SHOT. TAPE WAS BROADCAST BY BBC.^ RECENTLY I REVIEWED A VIDEOTAPE OF THE BBC TELECAST AND CAN FIND NOTHING THAT COMES CLOSE TO DEPICTING ANY ORGAN REMOVAL. AFTER HIS RETURN FROM CHINA~ THE LAOGAI RESEARCH FOUNDATION~ OF WHICH HE IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR~ ISSUED CLAIM THAT NO ATTEMPT TO MISLEAD WAS INTENDED. CHING-LEE WU~ HIS WIFE~ SPOKE IN WU'S STEAD AT THE STANFORD MEETING AND USED THE OCCASION TO UNVEIL A ^NEW DOCUMENTARY^ ON PUBLIC EXECUTIONS IN CHINA. FILM WAS CO-PRODUCED BY WU'S LAOGAI FOUNDATION AND FREEDOM HOUSE AND REFLECTED WU'S TYPICAL APPROACH OF MIXING HISTORICAL FACTS WITH UNSUPPORTED ASSERTIONS SKILLFULLY WOVEN WITH ^BACKGROUND SHOTS.^ INCONSISTENCIES AND SHIFTING STATEMENTS ABOUND FROM WU'S PUBLIC UTTERANCES AND ACTIVITIES. REAL PUZZLE IS WHY AND HOW THE MEDIA HAVE SO WILLINGLY SWALLOWED WU'S UTTERANCES. I BELIEVE WU HAS SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS WITH VESTED INTERESTS IN CONTAINING CHINA THROUGH PUBLIC OPINION~ IRRESPECTIVE OF TRUTH AND FACTS. ONE OF WU'S MORE OBVIOUS SPONSORS IS THE AFL-CIO. AN ABC NIGHTLINE PROGRAM REVEALED THAT HIS CLANDESTINE TRIP INTO CHINA VIA KAZAKSTAN WAS FINANCED BY THE AFL-CIO~ AND THE ATTORNEY WHO ACCOMPANIED WU WAS ON THE AFL-CIO PAYROLL. AFTER THE TWO WERE DETAINED~ SHE WAS PROMPTLY RELEASED AND THAT WAS HOW THE WORLD FIRST HEARD ABOUT WU'S ARREST. WU IS NOW MORE USEFUL TO THE AFL-CIO BY BECOMING A PUBLIC ANTI-CHINA SPOKESPERSON ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN LABOR. THE LAOGAI RESEARCH FOUNDATION IS IN THE AFL-CIO'S WASHINGTON D.C. HEADQUARTERS BUILDING. I TRIED TO REACH THE FOUNDATION VIA THE AFL-CIO. THE HEADQUARTERS SWITCHBOARD TRANSFERRED MY CALL TO THEIR FOOD AND ALLIED SERVICES TRADE WHO THEN SWITCHED THE CALL OVER TO A LINE WITH A RECORDED MESSAGE REPRESENTING THE FOUNDATION. MY RECORDED MESSAGE REQUESTING INFO WAS EVENTUALLY FORWARDED TO HARRY WU IN MILPITAS~ CALIFORNIA. AFL-CIO'S AGENDA ON CHINA AND ITS DEPENDENCE ON WU IS NO SECRET; THE MEDIA SIMPLY HAVE NOT SEEN FIT TO REPORT THE MATTER. IN A TESTIMONY BEFORE THE CONGRESS 7/95~ PEGGY TAYLOR~ DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT OF LEGISLATION OF AFL-CIO~ MADE SPECIFIC MENTION OF ^THIS LUCRATIVE TRADE^ IN ORGAN TRANSPLANTS FROM PRISONERS AS REASON TO DENY MOST FAVORED NATION (MFN) TRADING STATUS TO CHINA.

PROPAGANDA,WORLDWIDE~ @50-96@ CIA USED AMERICAN MODERN ART~ ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM~ INCLUDING JACKSON POLLOCK~ ROBERT MOTHERWELL~ WILLEM DE KOONING AND MARK ROTHKO - AS A WEAPON IN THE COLD WAR. CIA SET UP A DIVISION~ PROPAGANDA ASSETS INVENTORY~ WHICH AT ITS PEAK COULD INFLUENCE MORE THAN 800 NEWSPAPERS~ MAGAZINES - THE WURLITZER. IN 1950~ THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS DIVISION (IOD) SUBSIDIZED AN ANIMATED VERSION OF GEORGE ORWELL'S ANIMAL FARM~ AND SPONSORED AMERICAN JAZZ ARTISTS~ OPERA RECITALS~ AND THE BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA'S INTERNATIONAL TOURS. ITS AGENTS PLACED IN FILM INDUSTRY~ IN PUBLISHING HOUSES~ EVEN AS TRAVEL WRITERS FOR THE CELEBRATED FODOR GUIDES. IT PROMOTED AMERICA'S ANARCHIC AVANT-GARDE MOVEMENT~ ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM. CENTERPIECE OF THE CIA CAMPAIGN BECAME THE CONGRESS FOR CULTURAL FREEDOM (CCF)~ A JAMBOREE OF INTELLECTUALS~ WRITERS~ HISTORIANS~ POETS~ AND ARTISTS WHICH WAS SET UP WITH CIA FUNDS IN 1950 AND RUN BY A CIA AGENT. CCF SPONSORED SEVERAL EXHIBITIONS OF ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM DURING 1950S. ^THE NEW AMERICAN PAINTING~^ VISITED EVERY BIG EUROPEAN CITY IN 1958-59. NELSON ROCKEFELLER~ AS PRESIDENT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BACKERS OF ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM. HIS MUSEUM WAS CONTRACTED TO CCF TO ORGANIZE AND CURATE MOST OF ITS IMPORTANT ART SHOWS. TOM BRADEN~ FIRST CHIEF OF CIA'S IOD~ WAS EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF MUSEUM IN 49. HE SAID IOD ^WANTED TO UNITE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WRITERS~ WHO WERE MUSICIANS~ WHO WERE ARTISTS~ TO DEMONSTRATE THAT U.S. WAS DEVOTED TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND TO INTELLECTUAL ACHIEVEMENT.
