ANALYTICAL SCIENCE IS NEVER INFALLIBLE; THE PROBABILITIES OF ERROR CAN BE REDUCED~ BUT NEVER ELIMINATED. THE BOOK CONCENTRATES ON THE ^BOMBERS~^ WHO DO THE ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY DEFINING THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF DETONATED EXPLOSIVES~ AND WHO ALSO CREATE AND TEST BOMBS. OFTEN WITHOUT DECONTAMINATING AFTER DOING THE LATTER AND HANDLING THE FORMER. THE EXPLOITS AND ERRORS OF THIS GROUP IN HANDLING THE UNABOMBER~ VANPAC~ WORLD TRADE~ AND OKLAHOMA CITY CASE ARE EXAMINED IN DETAIL WITH GOOD DOCUMENTATION. IN ADDITION~ THE PROBLEMS WITH COVERUP AND JUST PLAIN POOR CRIME-SCENE SEARCH ARE DOCUMENTED IN THE RUBY RIDGE CASE. PROBLEMS IN THE DNA UNIT ARE EXPLORED~ USING THE O.J.

THE FILM'S SECRET PRODUCER WAS CIA. IT WAS WORRIED THAT THE PUBLIC MIGHT BE TOO INFLUENCED BY ORWELL'S POX-ON-BOTH-THEIR-HOUSES CRITIQUE OF THE CAPITALIST HUMANS AND COMMUNIST PIGS. SO AFTER ORWELL'S DEATH IN 1950~ CIA AGENTS SENT BY E. HOWARD HUNT BOUGHT THE FILM RIGHTS TO ^ANIMAL FARM^ FROM HIS WIDOW TO MAKE THE STORY'S MESSAGE MORE OVERTLY ANTI-COMMUNIST.

AMERICANS ARMED THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE AFTER THE USSR INVADED IN 1979 TO RESCUE A COMMUNIST REGIME IN KABUL. CIA ORCHESTRATED MASSIVE ARMS SHIPMENTS VIA PAKISTAN~ INCLUDING STINGER MISSILES. THREE U.S. ADMS PROMOTED A POLICY THROUGH A DECADE OF WAR. IN 1988~ GORBACHEV~ AGREED TO A SOVIET WITHDRAWAL. BUT THE VICTORS [FOUGHT AMONG THEMSELVES]. WHEN THEY FINALLY MANAGED IN 1992 TO DISLODGE THE ABANDONED COMMUNIST REGIME~ THEY SHELLED ONE ANOTHER~ DEVASTATING THEIR OWN CAPITAL AND PILLAGING ITS TREASURES. DESPERATE FARMERS TURNED TO ONE SURE CASH CROP--POPPIES. OUTPUT SOARED~ AND AFGHANISTAN TODAY PRODUCES THREE TIMES MORE OPIUM THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD TOGETHER. WARLORDS OF THE...THE DRUG TRAFFIC~ AIDED BY A DOZEN FOREIGN PATRONS~ CARVED THE COUNTRY INTO FRACTIOUS ENCLAVES. THEN IN [1994-1995]~ THE TALIBAN - THESE SOLDIERS OF ALLAH STORMED KABUL IN 1996. [STRINGENT] DECREES FOLLOWED. AS THE TALIBAN WENT ON TO CONQUER ALL BUT THE NORTHERN FRINGE OF AFGHANISTAN~ [THEY EXPORTED] SOME 35~000 MUSLIM MILITANTS FROM 40 ISLAMIC COUNTRIES TOOK WHO PART IN THE AFGHAN JIHAD. THE AFGHAN-INSPIRED MILITANTS [HELPED] MUSLIMS IN WESTERN CHINA AND EGYPT AND ALGERIA. IN NEW YORK~ ZEALOTS TRUCK-BOMBED THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN 1993.

IN ISLAMABAD~ BRZEZINSKI STRUCK A DEAL WITH ZIA THAT DETERMINED WHAT FOLLOWED...ALL ARMS FOR THE RESISTANCE MUST BE THROUGH PAKISTAN AND NOT DIRECTLY FROM THE CIA. ZIA WAS ADAMANT: PAKISTAN'S INTER-SERVICE INTELLIGENCE RECEIVE[D] AND DISTRIBUTE[D] ALL WEAPONS. THE U.S. LET ISLAMABAD DICTATE ITS AFGHAN POLICY. ...AS A FRONT-LINE STATE IN A HOLY WAR~ PAKISTAN IN TIME RECEIVED BILLIONS IN AID FROM SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER GULF SHEIKDOMS--EVEN AS IT TURNED TO CHINA FOR STILL MORE HELP. ZIA ONLY ALLOWED RELIGIOUSLY ORIENTED RESISTANCE GROUPS TO OPERATE IN PAKISTAN. HIS AIM...WAS TO INSTALL AN ISLAMIST REGIME IN KABUL...AND INTO THE PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM REPUBLICS OF SOVIET CENTRAL ASIA. THE PAKISTAN INTELLIGENCE GAVE ITS WEAPONS TO GULBUDDIN HEKMATYAR~ THE MOST FANATIC AND ANTI-AMERICAN OF THE SEVEN COMMANDERS OF THE MAIN RESISTANCE GROUPS. LATER~ HE BECAME THE LEADER~ TRAINER AND INSPIRATION TO THE TERRORISTS AND GUERRILLAS OF THE AFGHAN INTERNATIONAL.

BORN TO PRIVILEGE~ THEY ALL WERE ARROGANT~ AND ENORMOUSLY SELF-CONFIDENT WHICH OFTEN GREATLY EXCEEDED THEIR COMPETENCE.^ CERTAINLY BISSELL'S BOOK VALIDATES THAT ASSESSMENT. ^REFLECTIONS~^ HOWEVER~ IS PARTICULARLY INFORMATIVE IN DESCRIBING BISSELL'S ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF THE U-2 SURVEILLANCE PLANE. THE U-2 CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOVIET AND CHINESE AND OTHER TARGETS. AFTER HIS SUCCESS IN GUIDING THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF THE U-2~ CIA IN 1958~ NAMED HIM DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PLANS (DDP). BISSELL'S INABILITIES SOON MANIFESTED THEMSELVES.

THE BOOK IN MANY ASPECTS IS THE MOST INFORMATIVE~ CONCISE AND ACCURATE OF MANY OF THE BOOKS ON CLANDESTINE OPS IN VIETNAM OF THE SPECIAL OPERATING GROUPS (SOGs) AND CIA'S VARIOUS PROGRAMS. THE U.S.'s LEADING WARTIME WRITER/SCHOLAR ON THE VIETCONG~ DOUGLAS PIKE~ WROTE THE CHAPTER~ ^THE VIETCONG SECRET WAR.^ HE STATES LIBERATION ASSOCIATIONS OF THE VC WERE VILLAGERS MOLDED INTO TIGHT-KNIT~ SELF-CONTROLLED~ SELF-CONTAINED ASSOCIATIONS. MAO TSE-TUNG OF CHINA AND VO NGUYEN GIAP HAD CALLED LIBERATION ASSOCIATIONS THE INITIAL PHASE AND THE SINE QUA NON OF THEIR REVOLUTIONS. IN 63~ THE VC ANNOUNCED THAT SEVEN MILLION SOUTH VIETNAMESE (GENERALLY RURAL CIVILIANS) HAD JOINED THESE ASSOCIATIONS. PIKE'S ARTICLE AVOIDS NUMBERS BUT THOSE MASSIVE FIGURES WERE INTEL COMMUNITY'S MOST SACROSANCT SECRET OR MOST EGREGIOUS FAILURE. IF CIA HAD KNOWN AND/OR REPORTED THE SEVEN - MILLION - PERSON - STRONG ASSOCIATION STRUCTURE -- IT WOULD HAVE INVALIDATED ALL U.S. JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE WAR; ERGO~ NO WAR. LIBERATION ASSOCIATION MEMBERS -- OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY -- MOST OF THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE -- AND THEIR DEDICATION~ CAUSED OUR DEFEAT IN VIETNAM. VICTORY WAS NEVER A POSSIBILITY. WILLIAM COLBY~ CIA'S MAIN MAN ON VIETNAM~ CALLED THE LIBERATION ASSOCIATIONS THE SKELETAL ORGANIZATIONS OF NO REAL POWER THAT CAME INTO EXISTENCE LATE IN THE FIGHTING.

THE COMPLETE STUDY WAS BEING PUBLISHED BY THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS OF EAST ASIA PROJECT~ CORNELL UNIVERSITY. GEORGE CARVER (A TOP OFFICIAL OF THE CIA AT THE TIME) PRESENTED HOANG TO THE PUBLIC. HOANG WAS A LANDLORD HIMSELF WITH 20 ACRES OF LAND IN NORTH VIETNAM. HOANG WAS EMPLOYED BY THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE AND U.S. INTEL. HIS STORY WAS PART OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS' PLANS TO PORTRAY LAND REFORM AS A BLOODBATH. HOANG WORKED FOR THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION FOR SOME EIGHT MONTHS AS A TRANSLATOR FOR USIA. IN 1958~ THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT PARTIALLY SUBSIDIZED HIS BOOK~ ^THE NEW CLASS IN NORTH VIETNAM.^ IN 60~ HE RECEIVED A CONGRESS OF CULTURAL FREEDOM (CIA) GRANT TO WRITE A MORE COMPLETE ATTACK ON LAND REFORM. ^FROM COLONIALISM TO COMMUNISM^ WAS SUBSIDIZED BY USIA WITH CIA MONEY. INVESTIGATION OF HIS ALLEGATIONS REVEALED GROSS DISTORTIONS. HE QUOTES A PARTY SLOGAN AS ^LIQUIDATE THE LANDLORDS.^ IN FACT THE SLOGAN WAS ^ABOLISH THE FEUDAL REGIME OF LAND OWNERSHIP IN A MANNER THAT IS DISCRIMINATING~ METHODICAL AND UNDER SOUND LEADERSHIP.^ PARTY DOCUMENTS POINTED OUT THAT THE PURPOSE OF LAND REFORM WAS NOT TO LIQUIDATE LANDLORDS BUT TO REDISTRIBUTE LAND AND POWER IN THE VILLAGES. THE MOST SERIOUS CASE OF MISREPRESENTATION IS HOANG'S TRANSLATION OF VO NGUYEN GIAP'S SPEECH IN 9/56. PHRASE ^TORTURE^ USED BY HOANG WAS ^COERCION^ USED BY GIAP.

THE BOOK SPENT 23 WEEKS AS NO. 1 ON THE ^NEW YORK TIMES^ BEST- SELLER LIST IN 1964~ DUE IN PART TO THE CIA'S HAM-HANDED ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK ITS PUBLICATION.

US SOCIETY LEANS TOWARD A BINARY VIEW OF THE WORLD. ITS SYMBOLS TEND TO BE GOOD OR EVIL~ SACRED OR SATANIC. BLENDS OF THE TWO REQUIRE STUDY.

WITHOUT THEIR PROPAGANDA MACHINE IT WOULD COLLAPSE. ^MODERN WARS REQUIRE SUPPORT OF EVERYONE~ AND SO WARTIME PROPAGANDA IDEALIZES THE HUMANE~ EGALITARIAN~ DEMOCRATIC CHARACTER OF THE HOME SOCIETY IN A WAY THAT NO ELITE OR BUSINESS INTEREST HAS ANY INTENTION OF ALLOWING.^ TAKING THE RISK OUT OF DEMOCRACY: PROPAGANDA IN THE US AND AUSTRALIA BY ALEX CAREY

BOOK REVIEW,@47-99@ ALLEN DULLES MASTER OF SPIES BY JAMES SRODES REVIEWED BY JEFF STEIN. DULLES WAS THE GREAT WHITE CASE OFFICER WHOSE WORLD WAR II SPYING AND FAMILY CONNECTIONS MADE HIM THE INEVITABLE CHOICE TO RUN THE FLEDGLING CIA. OUR FATHERS REALLY DID HOLD THE FATE OF THE WORLD IN THEIR HANDS FOR THE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE CENTURY. [BUT] THE SECRET AGENTS OF OSS~ OR OFFICE OF SPECIAL SERVICES~ HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE WAR'S OUTCOME. DULLES WAS A FIRST-RATE AGENT HANDLER. IN SWITZERLAND~ HIS MOST IMPORTANT AGENT WAS A CLERK IN THE GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTRY~ WHO SHOWED UP AFTER BEING REBUFFED BY THE BRITISH AND BEGAN FEEDING DULLES GERMAN CABLES. DULLES ALSO CONSPIRED IN PLOTS TO KILL HITLER OR INDUCE A NAZI SURRENDER~ ALL OF WHICH FAILED. HE WAS EISENHOWER'S CHIEF INSTRUMENT FOR OVERTHROWING GOVERNMENTS OR OTHERWISE SECRETLY SWAYING EVENTS AROUND THE WORLD. EVER THE OPERATOR~ DULLES ALSO NEVER GAVE UP GATHERING HIS OWN INFO~ EITHER FROM HIS WIDE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS OR FROM YOUNG AGENTS JUST IN FROM THE FIELD~ WHOM HE'D OFTEN SUMMON TO HIS OFFICE FOR A FIRST-HAND BRIEFING. THE AGENCY WAS ON LOOSE FOOTING ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD. THE KOREAN WAR CAUGHT THE CIA BY SURPRISE. DESPITE EARLY SUCCESSES IN OVERTHROWING SOCIALIST REGIMES IN IRAN AND GUATEMALA IN 1954~ IT FAILED MISERABLY IN INDONESIA~ TIBET~ VIETNAM AND~ CUBA. THE CIA WAS LULLED BY ITS EASY COUP D'ETAT IN IRAN~ INTO THINKING THAT IT COULD APPLY COVERT ACTION LIKE A KIT. THE FAILED INVASION OF CUBA (BAY OF PIGS) WAS HIS WATERLOO. THE FAILED INVASION COST HIM HIS JOB. NOT EVEN ENLISTING IN PLOTS TO ASSASSINATE CASTRO AND OTHER FOREIGN LEADERS~ COULD SAVE HIM. <WP 6/20/99 X2

BOOK REVIEW,@65-97@ BOOK~ A SPY FOR ALL SEASONS BY D. CLARRIDGE WITH D. DIEHL. THIS [IS A] SWAGGERING~ DEFIANT MEMOIR. DCI CASEY~ WAS PRESSURING CLARRIDGE TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT THE CONTRA REBELS IN THEIR WAR AGAINST NICARAGUA'S AND CLARRIDGE DECIDED ON SEA MINES WHICH PROVED A POLITICAL DISASTER. CONGRESS AND PRESS WENT INTO ^HYSTERIA.^ HE SETTLES OLD SCORES WITH UNDISGUISED GLEE. HE HAS NO USE FOR ^SPONGY LIBERALS^ OR THE ^HOUNDS OF THE PRESS.^ CLARRIDGE SUFFERS FROM A CHRONIC CASE OF MACHISMO~ AND AN UNBOUNDED EGO. HE DOES NOT KNOW OF NOT A SINGLE SIGNIFICANT CASE WHERE CIA RECRUITED A SOVIET -- EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS THE AGENCY'S MAJOR TARGET AROUND THE GLOBE DURING MORE THAN FOUR DECADES OF COLD WAR. (THE SOVIET AGENTS WHO WORKED FOR THE CIA WERE ALL WALK-IN VOLUNTEERS.) HE WENT TO PREP SCHOOL AND BROWN UNIVERSITY~ JOINED THE CIA AND WAS SENT TO NEPAL~ NEW DELHI~ MADRAS~ INDIA~ ISTANBUL AND ANKARA~ TURKEY. LATER HE WAS COS IN ROME~ ITALY~ HE BECAME CHIEF OF THE LATIN AMERICA DIVISION AND ARCHITECT OF THE CONTRA WAR. [HIS] LAUDABLE GOALS ARE NOT ACCOMPLISHED BY COVERT OPS THAT CIRCUMVENT THE LAW OR BY MISLEADING CONGRESS. ONE DOES NOT SAVE DEMOCRACY BY VIOLATING ITS RULES. CLARRIDGE DIDN'T GET IT.

BOOK REVIEW,@70-96@ ROBERT GATES BOOK~ FROM THE SHADOWS: THE ULTIMATE INSIDER'S STORY OF FIVE PRESIDENTS AND HOW THEY WON THE COLD WAR~ REVIEWED BY DAVID CORN IN THE 5/13/96 ISSUE OF THE NATION. GATES USED TO DELIVER A SPEECH ^WAR BY ANOTHER NAME~ A STANGELOVIAN SCREED AGAINST THE SOVIETS. IN HIS CONFIRMATION HEARINGS GATES CONFESSED RE THAT SPEECH TO A CERTAIN POETIC LICENSE. GATES WAS A BLIND-TO-CHANGE HAWK AND CIA MISSED THE BIGGEST STORY OF ITS LIFE~ THE COLLAPSE OF ITS PRIMARY FOE. MANY DOCUMENTS GATES CITES HAVE BEEN DECLASSIFIED ONLY FOR USE IN THIS BOOK. GATES NOTES THAT PRESIDENTS ROUTINELY IGNORE OR DISMISS INTELLIGENCE. HE SKATES PAST THE ALDRICH AMES DEBACLE~ BUT HE DID NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF THE CIA'S SELF-PROTECTING CULTURE WHEN HE WAS DCI. GATES SAYS THE CIA ROUTINELY UNDERESTIMATED SOVIET PARANOIA~ THE REAGAN ADM WITH LITTLE EVIDENCE~ OVERREACTED TO THE THREAT OF ASSASSINATION FROM LIBYA. HE CONFESSES HE BUNGLED HIS ROLE IN IRAN/CONTRA BY NOT PROTESTING MORE. WEAPONS AND TRAINING PROVIDED BY CIA TO PARAMILITARISTS AROUND THE WORLD ^WERE EVEN USED IN ACTIONS HOSTILE TO U.S. INTERESTS.^ THE CIA PER GATES~ ^NEVER RECRUITED A SPY WHO GAVE US UNIQUE POLITICAL INFO ON FROM INSIDE THE KREMLIN.^ IT OVERSTATED THE SOVIET ECONOMY. GATES WAS LIKE A NEAR-DEAF MAN AT A SYMPHONY -- HE COULD HEAR A FEW NOTES AND ONLY THE LOUDEST. HE SAW ALL SITUATIONS IN THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN U.S. AND RUSSIA. THIS WAS TRUE RE NICARAGUA AND THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY THE CONTRA WAR. THE SAME FOR THE CIVIL WAR IN ANGOLA~ AND CIA OPERATIONS IN IRAN. IN AFGHANISTAN GATES SAID~ WE NEVER CONSIDERED IT WOULD BECOME A HAVEN FOR TERRORISTS OPERATING WORLDWIDE WITH TRAINING AND SUPPLIES FROM THE CIA. HE DOES NOT TELL US WHY IT WAS NECESSARY FOR US TO SUPPORT THE GUATEMALAN ARMY THAT SLAUGHTERED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS. HE DOES RECORD THE SALVADORAN PEASANTS MASSACRED BY AN ^ANTICOMMUNIST^ MILITARY~ HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS SLAUGHTERED IN INDONESIA BY A U.S. ALLY~ OR CHILEANS MURDERED BY PINOCHET'S REGIME. THIS BOOK APPEARS TO BE COOKING THE RECORD. U.S. INTEL OVER THE YEARS AFFLICTED BY POLICY TRUMPING FACTS. FORTUNATELY~ THERE'S ENOUGH HISTORY OUT THERE~ BEYOND THE CONTROL OF CIA~ TO COUNTER THE LAST PROPAGA NDA CAMPAIGN OF THE LAST CIA DIRECTOR OF THE COLD WAR. <NA 5/13/96

BOOK REVIEW,@75-78@ BOOK~ CHALLENGING THE SECRET GOVERNMENT: THE POST WATERGATE INVESTIGATIONS OF CIA AND FBI~ BY KATHRYN OLMSTED~ REVIEWED BY S. KUTLER. FOUR MONTHS AFTER SEYMOUR HERSH REVEALED THAT THE CIA HAD ENGAGED IN MASSIVE DOMESTIC SURVEILLANCE THE CONGRESS SEEMINGLY BENT ON REFORMING THE CORRUPT INSTITUTIONS OVER 18 MONTHS EVAPORATED ITS ZEAL. OLMSTED MASTERED THE VOLUMINOUS PIKE AND CHURCH COMMITTEE REPORTS AND ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF HOW CONGRESS~ THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH~ THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE MEDIA RESPONDED. HER CONCLUSIONS ARE DEVASTATING: CONGRESS HAD LITTLE INTEREST; FORD'S WHITE HOUSE~ FOUGHT SKILLFULLY TO LIMIT AND DISCREDIT INQUIRIES; AND THE MEDIA PROVED A USEFUL~ COMPLIANT ACCOMPLICE OF BOTH. THE HOUSE PIKE INVESTIGATION WAS MORE INCISIVE~ CRITICAL AND DANGEROUS TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. WHITE HOUSE AND CIA MOUNTED A FEROCIOUS PUBLIC CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT PIKE COMMITTEE. IN DECEMBER 75~ THE CIA'S ATHENS STATION CHIEF~ RICHARD WELCH~ WAS ASSASSINATED. EXECUTIVE BRANCH~ ^DANCED WITH JOY ON HIS GRAVE.^ THEY BLAMED MEDIA AND COMMITTEES~ ALTHOUGH IT WAS OBVIOUS THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WELCH'S DEATH. CIA ACCUSED PIKE COMMITTEE OF ^LOSING^ SEVERAL HUNDRED DOCUMENTS - A FEW DAYS COMMITTEE'S STAFF FOUND THEM IN CIA'S FILES. PIKE CALLED IT A DOMESTIC COVERT ACTION BUT THE DAMAGE WAS DONE - THE MEDIA REPORTED LOSS BUT NOT THE FINDING. PRESIDENT FORD FOUND HIS HAND SO STRENGTHENED THAT HE RECOMMENDED LEGITIMIZING CIA DOMESTIC ACTIVITIES~ AND STRENGTHENING THE POWER OF THE DCI TO PUNISH WHISTLEBLOWERS. NEWLY ESTABLISHED CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES HAD A LARGE NUMBER OF FORMER CIA OFFICERS ON THEIR STAFFS. CONGRESSIONAL REFORM EFFORTS FALTERED BECAUSE MANY MEMBERS APPROVED AND THE MEDIA WAS WOOED AND INTIMIDATED BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL WRITERS BORDERED ON THE ABSURD AS THEY ATTACKED CIA CRITICS. THE FAILURE TO CONFRONT THE UNACCOUNTABILITY HAD FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALLY A DECADE LATER WITH DCI WILLIAM CASEY AND HIS CONTEMPT FOR CONGRESS. <NA 3/18/96 29-31

DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS~ FBI'S STANDING AS A WORLD LEADER IN THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF CRIME ARTIFACTS HAS TAKEN HARD HITS. FREDERICK WHITEHURST~ A PHD CHEMIST AND FBI AGENT CHARGES THE FBI CRIME LAB OFTEN PERFORMED IN UNACCEPTABLY SLOPPY AND BIASED WAYS. OTHER CRITICS HAVE INCLUDED A SURPRISING NUMBER OF FBI AGENTS~ THE JUSTICE'S IG AND A SCATTERING OF FEDERAL PROSECUTORS~ JUDGES AND INDEPENDENT FORENSIC SCIENTISTS. TAINTING EVIDENCE~ A POWERFUL NEW BOOK~ HAS PROVIDES A [NEEDED] PERSPECTIVE. THE FAILURES OF THE LAB~ ARE NOT ISOLATED EVENTS. RATHER~ THERE ARE STRONG EVIDENCE OF SYSTEMATIC BUREAUCRATIC ROT. CRIME LAB REPORTING HAS BECOME A FORMIDABLE OP. IN 1996~ THE LAB CONDUCTED 696~543 EXAMS OF ^EVIDENTIARY ITEMS^ FOR FEDERAL~ STATE AND LOCAL INVESTIGATIVE AGENCIES AND PROSECUTORS. IT PERFORMED MORE THAN TWO MILLION LATENT FINGERPRINT EXAMS AND PROCESSED 8~307 POLYGRAPH OR LIE-DETECTOR TESTS. FBI EMPLOYEES IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS~ TESTIFIED IN 2~813 CASES. THROUGH INTERVIEWS~ ANALYSES OF THE FBI'S FORENSIC WORK IN~ AND MINING OF FOIA REQUESTS THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT THE LAB HAS FAILED TO MEET THE SCIENTIFIC AND ETHICAL STANDARDS.

BOOK REVIEW,@94-95@ BUD MCFARLANE'S BOOK~ SPECIAL TRUST~ REVIEWED BY DOUG VAUGHAM. BOOK IS A SELF-SERVING JUSTIFICATION OF HIS ROLE IN SHAPING BUSH'S FOREIGN POLICY. IRAN-CONTRA'S LABYRINTHINE PLOT LINES AND ETHICAL CONUNDRUMS ARE A FULL THIRD OF MEMOIR. LAW DID NOT STOP CIA DCI CASEY'S VENDETTA AGAINST SHEIKH FADLALLAH~ WHICH LED DIRECTLY TO BOMBING OF A BEIRUT MOSQUE~ KILLING 83 PEOPLE. HEZBOLLAH'S KIDNAPPING OF BEIRUT STATION'S WILLIAM BUCKLEY SET OFF FRANTIC SEARCH OPS COORDINATED BY OLIVER NORTH THAT LED TO SHIPMENTS OF MISSILES AS RANSOM -- MCFARLANE DOES NOT MENTION THE MOSQUE BOMBING NOR THE 30~000 DEAD NICARAGUANS NOR THE 70~000 IN EL SALVADOR.

BOOK REVIEW,@94@ BOOK~ DIPLOMACY~ BY KISSINGER REVIEWED BY WILLIAM READ. BOOK NOT ABOUT DIPLOMACY IN GENERAL - IT ABOUT AMERICAN DIPLOMACY AT END OF COLD WAR. KISSINGER BELIEVES U.S. NEEDS A MORE SOPHISTICATED INTELLECTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR ITS FOREIGN POLICY. U.S. NEEDS TO ABSORB EUROPEAN IDEAS ABOUT REALISM AND POWER POLITICS. HE CRITICIZES CONSEQUENCES OF MORALISTIC~ WISHFUL THINKING OF FOREIGN POLICY DURING COLD WAR. THERE WERE NO REAL AMERICAN INTEREST IN VN. ^MY POLICY WOULD HAVE WORKED IF AMERICAN PEOPLE HAD BEEN WILLING TO FIGHT INDEFINITELY IN INDOCHINA.^ BUT HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS. ECONOMIC INTERESTS DO NOT ENGAGE KISSINGER. ECONOMICS HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH DIPLOMACY.

BOOK REVIEW,@94@ THE BOOK~ THE USE OF AMERICAN MILITARY FORCE IN POST-COLD WAR WORLD BY RICHARD N. HAASS~ REVIEWED BY LTC DEMAREST~ FOREIGN MILITARY STUDIES OFFICE~ FORT LEAVENWORTH~ KANSAS. HAASS IMPLIES US MILITARY MUST BE ABLE TO RESPOND CONSTANTLY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY TO A LONG GAMUT OF MISSIONS AND THAT ITS ROLE IN POST-COLD WAR WORLD IS INTERVENTION. HAASS SUMMARIZES MANY RECENT US INTERVENTIONS AND PROPOSES A LIST OF TYPES THAT INCLUDES DETERRENCE~ PREVENTIVE ATTACKS~ COMPELLENCE~ PUNITIVE ATTACKS~ PEACEKEEPING~ PEACEMAKING~ WARFIGHTING~ NATIONBUILDING~ INTERDICTION~ HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE~ RESCUE AND INDIRECT USE OF FORCE. HIS PRESENTATION WHEN~ WHERE~ WHY AND HOW TO INTERVENE IS EVEN-TEMPERED~ UNDOGMATIC AND NONPARTISAN. QUESTION OF WHETHER U.S. HAS A RIGHT TO INTERVENE IS FINESSED BEHIND ASSERTION THAT US ISOLATIONISM IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE. ^POPULAR AND CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT ARE DESIRABLE BUT NOT NECESSARY.^ WEINBERGER'S SAYS~ ^BEFORE THE U.S. COMMITS COMBAT FORCES ABROAD~ THERE MUST BE SOME REASONABLE ASSURANCE WE WILL HAVE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THEIR ELECTED REPS IN CONGRESS.^ HAASS STATES~ THAT ^THERE IS DECLINING POPULAR AND CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR MILITARY INTERVENTIONS. PROPER RESPONSE IS NOT TO BOW TO THIS MOOD BUT TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT. SUSTAINING INTERVENTIONS WILL REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL POLITICAL EFFORT FROM THE MOST SENIOR LEVELS OF GVT.^ ^TO DRAW A DIRECT CONNECTION OR PARALLEL BETWEEN THE IMPORTANCE OF AN INTEREST AND A WILLINGNESS TO INTERVENE ON ITS BEHALF WOULD BE WRONG.^ HE DOES NOT SAY NATIONAL INTEREST IS IRRELEVANT BUT RECOMMENDS MAKING DECISIONS TO INTERVENE DEPEND EVEN MORE ON THE PERSONAL CRITERIA AND JUDGMENT OF A FOREIGN POLICY ELITE. HAASS IMPLIES THAT U.S. CAN PROVIDE EFFECTIVE NATION ASSISTANCE~ OUGHT TO PROVIDE NATION ASSISTANCE AND CAN DO IT WITH MILITARY FORCES. IF YOU LIKE INTERVENTIONS~ YOU WILL LOVE INTERVENTION.

AT A NUMBER OF CRUCIAL TURNS FROM 1970S TO THE EARLY 1990S. GATES'S ACCOUNTS OF UPHEAVALS FROM SOUTHERN AFRICA TO THE NEAR EAST~ FROM CENTRAL AMERICA TO SOUTHEAST ASIA ARE DRAPED IN LANGUAGE ABOUT MOSCOW'S RECKLESS STRATAGEMS VERSUS WASHINGTON'S BOLD COUNTER-MOVES. BOOK IS DEVOID OF ANY RECOGNITION THAT LOCAL GRIEVANCES~ FAR MORE THAN SOVIET INSTRUCTION~ DROVE PEASANTS INTO REBELLION AGAINST CORRUPT RULERS. GATES OFFERS CANDID INSIGHTS INTO CIA OPS OF THE ERA. HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT FROM THE LATE 1970S~ CIA LAUNCHED COVERT OPS TO SUBSIDIZE ANTI-COMMUNIST PUBLICATIONS IN EASTERN EUROPE AND TO SMUGGLE ANTI-RUSSIAN LITERATURE INTO THE ETHNIC REGIONS OF THE SOVIET UNION. IN 1991~ GATES WAS CONFIRMED AS GEORGE BUSH'S DCI. KEY SENATORS HAD BLOCKED GATES'S NOMINATION AS CIA DIRECTOR IN 1987 BECAUSE OF SUSPICIONS THAT GATES~ AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR~ HAD MISLED CONGRESS ABOUT THE IRAN-CONTRA SCANDAL.

BOOK REVIEW,IRAQ~ @90-99@ OUT OF THE ASHES THE RESURRECTION OF SADDAM HUSSEIN BY ANDREW COCKBURN AND PATRICK COCKBURN. THE HUNT FOR IRAQ'S HIDDEN WEAPONS BY TIM TREVAN. REVIEWED BY JOHN PRADOS. A GREAT FAILURE IS TRACKING DOWN AND DISPOSING OF IRAQ'S WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. THOUGH THE COALITION ACHIEVED ITS PROXIMATE AIM OF REVERSING THE IRAQI CONQUEST OF KUWAIT~ THE UN RESOLUTION PROVIDED FOR IRAQ TO BE DEPRIVED OF ITS MOST DANGEROUS WEAPONRY~ AND THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED. PATRICK COCKBURN~ REPORTED ON THE IMPACT OF UN SANCTIONS ON IRAQ AS WELL AS POLITICAL EVENTS IN THAT COUNTRY. PATRICK TEAMED UP WITH HIS BROTHER ANDREW. OUT OF THE ASHES~ IS THE MOST DETAILED LOOK AT POST-GULF WAR IRAQ. THE REVOLTS OF SOME ARMY UNITS~ OF SHIA MUSLIMS~ AND OF THE KURDISH ETHNIC MINORITY THAT AFTER THE GULF WAR EMERGE IN CLEAR RELIEF. IRAQI GENERALS MAY HAVE BEEN PLANNING A MILITARY COUP AGAINST SADDAM THAT WAS SHORT-CIRCUITED BY THE OTHER REVOLTS. AN ABORTIVE REVOLT BY PORTIONS OF SADDAM'S PERSONAL GUARD NEVER HAD MUCH CHANCE. THE NEARLY SUCCESSFUL ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AGAINST SADDAM'S SON UDAY~ IN 12/96~ IS TRACED TO THE URBAN ELITE OF BAGHDAD~ AND ITS REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT ^THE AWAKENING...^ BUSH APPROVED CIA COVERT ACTION AGAINST SADDAM~ WHICH CLINTON PURSUED~ AS THE CIA EFFORT MUDDLED ON. THE CIA OP SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CRIPPLED BY DIVIDED OPINION~ DIFFERING EMPHASES BY ASSORTED CIA COMPONENTS~ AND FIELD OFFICERS EXCEEDING THEIR AUTHORITY~ ALL COUPLED WITH THE SHIFTING ALLEGIANCES OF THE IRAQI OPPOSITION ELEMENTS. ONE CIA OFFICER AMONG THE KURDS~ ALMOST SINGLE-HANDEDLY INSTIGATED THE 1996 UPRISING THAT SPLIT THE KURDS~ RESULTED IN AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN SADDAM AND ONE KURDISH FACTION WITH PREVIOUS TIES TO THE CIA~ AND INCREASED IRAQ'S CONFIDENCE IN OBSTRUCTING THE UN DISARMAMENT PROGRAM. THE WEAKNESS IN THIS BOOK IS ITS COVERAGE OF THE UN INSPECTORS~ WHICH SINCE 1991 HAS HAD RESPONSIBILITY FOR RIDDING IRAQ OF ITS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. TIM TREVAN'S SADDAM'S SECRETS (HELPS). A BRITISH TECHNICAL SPECIALIST AND DIPLOMAT~ TREVAN SERVED AS SPECIAL ADVISER TO THE HEAD OF UNSCOM FROM 1/92 TO 10/95~ WHICH [IS] WHEN THE INSPECTORS ACHIEVED THEIR GREATEST SUCCESSES. WE SEE NUMEROUS IRAQI PREVARICATION'S AND STEADILY INCREASING EFFORTS TO OBSTRUCT THE UN INSPECTORS. [THEY WERE] FRUSTRATED BY THE VAGUE RECOLLECTIONS OF IRAQI SCIENTISTS. THE SEPTEMBER 1991 INCIDENT WHEN IRAQI TROOPS HELD UN INSPECTORS AT GUNPOINT FOR FOUR DAYS. TREVAN'S ACCOUNT OF THIS IS EYE-OPENING: UNSCOM'S TEAM SMUGGLED KEY DOCUMENTS OUT WITH A SPECIALIST WHO HAD TO BE EVACUATED FOR MEDICAL REASONS.

BOOK REVIEW,THOMAS~ E. (1995). THE VERY BEST MEN FOUR WHO DARED: THE EARLY YEARS OF THE CIA. NY: SIMON & SCHUSTER. DAVID WISE SAID ^THIS WAS A JEWEL OF A BOOK RE THE INSIDE THE CIA. CIA MEN FELT SURVIVAL OF THE FREE WORLD DEPENDED ON THEM. BORN TO PRIVILEGE~ THEY ALL WERE ARROGANT~ AND ENORMOUSLY SELF-CONFIDENT WHICH OFTEN GREATLY EXCEEDED THEIR COMPETENCE.^ THE BOOK FOCUSES ON THE ^EASTERN ELITE~^ LEADERSHIP OF CIA VIA PRIMARILY FOUR MEN - FRANK WISNER~ RICHARD BISSELL~ DESMOND FITZGERALD AND TRACY BARNES. DURING THEIR ASCENDANCY~ THE POLICIES OF THE AGENCY CAME MORE FROM THE DRAWING ROOMS OF GEORGETOWN~ THAN HEADQUARTERS PLANNING SESSIONS. ALLEN DULLES~ THE FATHER OF THE CIA~ SAID IT WAS NECESSARY TO READ THE SOCIETY PAGES FOR MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION. WHAT BECOMES CLEAR IS HOW LITTLE THIS ^ELITE^ DWELT ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS AND HOW MUCH THEY ACCEPTED THE COLD WAR-CONTRIVED EXCUSES FOR OVERTHROWING POPULAR GOVERNMENTS. ONE OF MORE FRIGHTENING ASPECTS WAS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DEFY THE CIA'S CHARTER RE DOMESTIC POLITICS -- INFLUENCING PUBLIC OPINION IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND DISCREDITING INDIVIDUALS USING DIRTY TRICKS. ONE OFFICER SAID~ ^WE WERE NOT IN THE LEAST INHIBITED BY THE FACT THAT CIA HAD NO INTERNAL SECURITY ROLE...^ THIS STATEMENT EPITOMIZES THE AGENCY'S ON-GOING THREAT TO OUR CONSTITUTIONAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT.

TIBETANS WERE KILLED~ BUT CHINA'S HOLD OVER TIBET WAS NEVER REALLY SHAKEN. BY THE END OF THE 1960S~ THE CIA ENDED THE EFFORT~ LEAVING THE TIBETANS EMBITTERED AND ABANDONED. DETAILS OF THE CIA'S TIBETAN PROGRAM HAVE LONG BEEN CLOAKED IN SECRECY. IN 1993~ THEN-CIA DCI WOOLSEY TOLD CONGRESS THAT THE FILES ON ACTIVITIES IN TIBET AND SEVERAL OTHER OF ITS COVERT OPS OF THE COLD WAR WOULD BE OPENED. THE CIA RENEGED. [OTHER] DOCS SHOW CIA PROVIDED AN ANNUAL SUBSIDY OF $180~000 TO THE DALAI LAMA FROM LATE 1950S THROUGH THE 1960S. A NEW BOOK ^ORPHANS OF THE COLD WAR^ WAS WRITTEN BY JOHN KENNETH KNAUS~ A FORMER CIA OPERATIVE. KNAUS POINTS OUT IN 1951 THE TRUMAN ADM TRIED TO PERSUADE THE DALAI LAMA TO LEAVE TIBET FOR EXILE. LATER HIS FLIGHT INTO EXILE WASN'T VOLUNTARY. KNAUS FOUND THAT THE CIA'S SUBSIDIES TO THE DALAI LAMA LASTED~ AT AN UNSPECIFIED LEVEL~ FROM ABOUT 1951 UNTIL 1974. BY 1969~ ^THE DECISION HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE TO ABANDON MUSTANG [THE HQS IN NEPAL FOR THE TIBETAN GUERRILLAS] FOR OPERATIONAL AND NOT GEOPOLITICAL REASONS.^ THE TIBETAN GUERRILLAS COULDN'T DO WHAT THEY HAD HOPED. THE CIA GAVE UP. BUT ALONG THE WAY~ CIA MISLED THEM TO THINKING THEY HAD AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT TIBET. ^THE AMERICANS WHO NEGOTIATED [WITH THE DALAI LAMA'S BROTHER] IN 1956 PROBABLY DID MAKE PROMISES [SUCH] PROMISES NEVER HONORED.^ ^THE NEGOTIATORS WERE FOR THE MOST PART OP OFFICERS SWEPT UP IN THE OPTIMISM OF THEIR OWN PLANS.^ <LAT 6/16/99

THE CHILDS BROTHERS AND THEIR WIVES WERE OPERATION SOLO. CHILDS GAVE THE FBI INFO ABOUT THE USSR FOR 20 YEARS. HE AVERAGED THREE TRIPS A YEAR TO MOSCOW FOR 20 YEARS.

UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE CIA~ THOUGH~ THIS IMPRESSIVELY REPORTED TALE OF ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS SECURITY BREACHES IN ANNALS OF ESPIONAGE IS TERRIFICALLY AND DARKLY HILARIOUS. AUTHORS - TIM WEINER~ DAVID JOHNSTON AND NEIL A. LEWIS~ OF THE NEW YORK TIMES - CANNOT AVOID TELLING A TALE THAT OFTEN UNFOLDS LIKE ^OUR MAN IN HAVANA^ MEETS MONTY PYTHON. EVEN THOUGH HIS RECORD AT CIA ^WAS MOSTLY A LAMENTABLE CHRONICLE OF MEDIOCRITY~^ AMES IS APPOINTED CI CHIEF OF SOVIET OPS SECTION AT CIA HQS AND GIVEN THE DOSSIER OF EVERY RUSSIAN WORKING SECRETLY FOR U.S. INTEL. HE SOLD THEIR NAMES TO MOSCOW. TEN WERE ARRESTED AND MOST EXECUTED. AMES' TREACHERY BRINGS QUICK RESULTS. MOSCOW HUNTS DOWN SPIES HE UNMASKS AND ROLLS THEM UP.

HE IS ACTUALLY ASSIGNED TO DEBRIEF A HIGH-RANKING RUSSIAN DEFECTOR. MOSCOW DID ITS PART TO DEFLECT SUSPICION FROM ITS EXTRAVAGANTLY CARELESS ASSOCIATE. IN ONE OF THE BOOK'S MOST RIVETING PASSAGES~ THE RUSSIANS PEPPER CIA WITH FALSE LEADS THROUGH DIPLOMATIC AND OTHER CHANNELS~ THOROUGHLY CONFOUNDING AMERICAN COUNTERSPIES. ^THE INABILITY OF THE CIA TO DEAL WITH A TRAITOR IN ITS MIDST WAS A PART OF ITS CULTURAL TRADITION OF SECRECY~ ARROGANCE~ AND DENIAL.^ CIA'S OWN REPORT ON AFFAIR BLAMED 23 OFFICIALS BY NAME~ INCLUDING THREE CIA DIRECTORS.

IF THE U.S. INTEL HAD HEEDED ITS OWN ANALYSIS OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY IN THE AFTERMATH OF WWII~ THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN NO COLD WAR. SECRECY WAS A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO REASONED ACTIONS BY AMERICA'S LEADERS AND ITS CITIZENS. BY WWII~ WE HAD DEVELOPED A BUREAUCRACY DEVOTED TO KEEPING SECRETS.

DMITRI POLYAKOV~ THE U.S. GVT'S SINGLE MOST VALUABLE SOURCE INSIDE THE SOVIET UNION FOR 18 YEARS. POLYAKOV DID NOT SELL SECRETS FOR MONEY. HE HELPED THE U.S. BECAUSE HE KNEW THE SOVIET SYSTEM WAS A FAILURE. AFTER THE SOVIETS LEARNED HIS IDENTITY FROM AMES~ HE WAS TRIED AND EXECUTED. IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT AMES HAS THE ABILITY TO SEVER ANY MORAL CONNECTION BETWEEN HIS ACTS AND THEIR BLOODY RESULTS. HE WAS~ AFTER ALL~ AN OFT-PROMOTED CAREER EMPLOYEE OF THE OPERATIONS DIRECTORATE OF THE CIA~ AN INSTITUTION NOT NOTED FOR ITS SENTIMENTALITY ABOUT MORAL CONSIDERATIONS. RECENT NEWS REPORTS CONFIRM THAT IN THE 1980S U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCIES ROUTINELY ARRANGED FOR HUNDREDS OF LATIN AMERICAN MILITARY OFFICERS TO BE SCHOOLED IN THE BLACK ARTS OF TORTURE AND EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTION. IN THE FINAL YEARS OF THE COLD WAR~ THERE WERE~ MORE THAN A FEW PEASANTS~ INTELLECTUALS AND LEFTIST ACTIVISTS WHO GOT A BULLET IN THE HEAD BECAUSE OF THE DECISIONS OF ETHICALLY COMPARTMENTALIZED CIA OFFICERS.

THE BLOOD ROAD: THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL AND THE VIETNAM WAR BY JOHN PRADOS. ^THE BLOOD TRAIL^ CLAIMS THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CUT OFF AND THE WAR COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WON. TRAIL BECOMES THE WINDOW ON STRATEGIC DEBATES IN THE JOHNSON AND NIXON ADMS~ AS WELL AS ON THE MYRIAD COMBAT OPS TO CONTROL IT. [BOOK] PRESENTS THE STORY OF THE STUDIES AND OBSERVATION GROUP~ KNOWN AS MACSOG~ OR JUST SOG~ AND THE SPECIAL FORCES~ OR GREEN BERETS. SOG WAS FORMED IN LATE 1963 WHEN THE U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE COMMAND TOOK OVER CIA-CONTROLLED INDIGENOUS SCOUTS USED TO MONITOR INFILTRATION FROM NORTH VIETNAM. IT GREW RAPIDLY~ RE THE TRAIL IN LAOS. U.S. SPECIAL FORCES~ AND SOMETIMES SOUTH VIETNAMESE SPECIAL FORCES~ ALSO WORKED AGAINST THE TRAIL. BOOK TELLS OF STRUGGLE BETWEEN U.S. OFFICIALS WHO WANTED TO TAKE THE WAR NORTH~ PLACING A MILITARY FORCE ASTRIDE THE TRAIL~ AND THOSE AGAINST IT BECAUSE THEY DOUBTED IT COULD BE SUPPORTED AND WORRIED ABOUT CHINESE INTERVENTION. RESULT WAS A ^HALTING AND INCONSISTENT STRATEGY^ BASED ON MASSIVE BOMBING (MORE TONNAGE DROPPED THAN IN ALL OF U.S. STRATEGIC BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II)~ TECHNOLOGY FIXES (E.G.~ THE ^MCNAMARA LINE^) AND SURVEILLANCE AND RAIDS BY SOG- AND GREEN BERET-CONTROLLED FORCES. WALT ROSTOW~ KISSINGER AND NIXON TOP THE LIST OF VILLAINS. HE DEFENDS ROBERT MCNAMARA~ AS ONE WHO ^RESPONDED^ TO PROPOSALS. NO MILITARY OFFICER WHO DEALT WITH HIM WILL ACCEPT THIS [DUE TO] HIS HIGH-HANDED ARROGANCE AND AMATEURISH UNDERSTANDING OF WAR AND STRATEGY. H.R.

MCNAMARA IS BREAKING HIS QUARTER-CENTURY PUBLIC SILENCE ON THE WAR THAT LEFT 58~000 AMERICANS DEAD AND BITTERLY DIVIDED THE COUNTRY. MCNAMARA~ WHOSE INTERNAL CRITICISM LED JOHNSON TO REPLACE HIM IN 68~ IS THE HIGHEST-RANKING FORMER U.S. OFFICIAL TO SAY PUBLICLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT PURSUING THE WAR WAS A MISTAKE. ``WE OF THE KENNEDY AND JOHNSON ADMINISTRATIONS ACTED ACCORDING TO WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE THE PRINCIPLES AND TRADITIONS OF OUR COUNTRY. BUT WE WERE WRONG. WE WERE TERRIBLY WRONG.'' ``WE WERE JUST WRONG~ BOTH MILITARY LEADERS AND CIVILIAN LEADERS~ IN FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THE NATURE OF THE CONFLICT AND FAILING TO RECOGNIZE EARLY ON THAT THE STRATEGY WE WERE FOLLOWING WOULD NOT ACCOMPLISH OUR OBJECTIVE. IN HIS BOOK~ ``IN RETROSPECT: THE TRAGEDY AND LESSONS OF VIETNAM^ MCNAMARA WRITES THAT HE AND OTHER KENNEDY AIDES KNEW LITTLE ABOUT INDOCHINA WHEN THEY FIRST BEGAN DEVELOPING POLICY TOWARD THE REGION. HE NOW FINDS IT INCREDIBLE THAT THEY FAILED TO CONSIDER THE POLITICAL~ MILITARY~ FINANCIAL AND HUMAN COSTS OF DEEPENING U.S. INVOLVEMENT. PRESIDENT JOHNSON SOUGHT ADVICE FROM FORMER PRESIDENT EISENHOWER ON BOMBING VIETNAM. IN A 2/17/65~ MEETING~ EISENHOWER COUNSELED THAT ``LBJ'S FIRST DUTY WAS TO CONTAIN COMMUNISM IN SOUTHEAST ASIA~'' EVEN IF IT MEANT THREATENING NUCLEAR WAR.

AND IF THE SOVIETS OR CHINESE THREATENED TO INTERVENE~ EISENHOWER SAID~ WE SHOULD PASS THE WORD BACK TO THEM TO TAKE CARE LEST DIRE RESULTS OCCUR TO THEM.

IN 11/63~ 78 AMERICANS HAD BEEN KILLED IN THE WAR IN VIETNAM. IN LATE 1964~ THE TOTAL STOOD AT 225. BY THE WAR'S END IN 1975~ IT HAD PASSED 58~000. MCNAMARA SERVED AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FROM 1961 TO 1968 AND PUSHED SO HARD FOR DEEPER AMERICAN MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN 64 AND 65 THAT CONFLICT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA BECAME KNOWN AS ^MCNAMARA'S WAR.^ LATER~ HE BROKE WITH PRESIDENT JOHNSON AND URGED A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION. CONVINCED THAT WAR WAS UNWINNABLE~ HE LEFT THE PENTAGON IN 68 TO HEAD THE WORLD BANK. THE BOOK ^IN RETROSPECT: THE TRAGEDY AND LESSONS OF VIETNAM~^ IS UNSPARING IN BLAMING HIMSELF AND GVT COLLEAGUES. HE LISTS ^11 MAJOR CAUSES FOR OUR DISASTER IN VIETNAM~^ INCLUDING MISJUDGING THE CAPACITY OF NORTH VIETNAM~ UNDERRATING NATIONALISM AS A FORCE IN THE WORLD~ FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THE LIMITATIONS OF HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT~ FAILING TO LEVEL WITH CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND~ CRUCIALLY~ POOR ORGANIZATION. MCNAMARA SAYS ULTIMATE CAUSE OF FAILURE LAY WITH THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE. ECHOING WHAT BOTH PRESIDENTS KENNEDY AND JOHNSON SAID~ MCNAMARA STATES THAT IT WAS THE ASIANS' WAR~ ULTIMATELY~ TO WIN OR LOSE. BY THE MID-1960S~ HE SAYS~ IT WAS CLEAR HAT POLITICAL STABILITY DID NOT EXIST AND WAS UNLIKELY EVER TO BE ACHIEVED AND THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE~ EVEN WITH OUR TRAINING ASSISTANCE AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT~ WERE INCAPABLE OF DEFENDING THEMSELVES. MCNAMARA INSISTS THAT AMERICAN BOMBING NEVER SERIOUSLY THREATENED HANOI'S CAPACITY TO WAGE WAR AND THAT AMERICAN GROUND OPS NEVER ESTABLISHED ANY REAL~ LASTING SECURITY IN THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE COUNTRYSIDE. NOR DID THE PACIFICATION PROGRAM WIN MANY HEARTS AND MINDS. BUT HE AND OTHERS~ FAILED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO QUESTION FLAWED ASSUMPTIONS AND TO FACE BASIC GEOPOLITICAL QUESTIONS AS THEY ESCALATED THE WAR AGAIN AND AGAIN. HE IDENTIFIES REPEATED OCCASIONS ON WHICH PORTENTS OF TROUBLE OR OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISENGAGEMENT WERE IGNORED: A DISSENT ON THE USE OF AIRPOWER FROM GEN. H.K. JOHNSON~ THE ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF~ IN 9/64; A CABLE FROM AMBASSADOR MAXWELL TAYLOR IN 12/64; A WARNING AGAINST ESCALATION FROM JOHNSON'S OLD SENATORIAL MENTOR~ RICHARD B. RUSSELL OF GEORGIA~ IN JUNE 1965. THE DOMINO THEORY ENUNCIATED BY PRESIDENT EISENHOWER AND SUBSCRIBED TO BY HIS THREE SUCCESSORS WAS WRONG: LOSS OF SOUTH VIETNAM NEVER THREATENED TO UNDERMINE THE ENTIRE AMERICAN POSITION IN ASIA OR TO UNDERCUT U.S. CREDIBILITY ELSEWHERE.

BOOK REVIEW,VIETNAM~ @59-75@ MCNAMARA~ ROBERT STRANGE. (1995). IN RETROSPECT: THE TRAGEDY AND LESSONS OF VIETNAM. NY: TIMES BOOKS. A SUPERFICIAL AND SELECTIVE MEA CULPA. THE FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE CLAIMS OUR GOVERNING ELITE HAD LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF THE VIETNAMESE AND THE WAR -- AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF 25 YEARS -- EXPLAINS ALL THAT THEY DID (DO) NOT KNOW. MCNAMARA DECRIES THE VIETNAMESE LACK OF RESOLVE TO FIGHT~ HE STILL DOES NOT REALIZE THAT THEY WON~ REPELLING THE WORLD'S STRONGEST MILITARY FORCE. MCNAMARA WAS THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST OF THE ^BEST AND BRIGHTEST~^ BUT HIS BOOK DOES NOT CITE A SINGLE COMMUNIST SOURCE. THE SHALLOWNESS OF HIS ANALYSIS EXPOSES THE INTELLECTUAL PROSTITUTION DEMANDED OF AMERICA'S ACADEMIC ELITE. ASIAN COMMUNIST LEADERS SET FORTH IN THEIR WRITINGS THE PLANS AND PROGRAMS OF THEIR REVOLUTIONS BUT I DOUBT IF ANY MEMBER OF THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST~ OR ANY OFFICER OF THE CIA~ EVER READ OR~ IF SO~ UNDERSTOOD THOSE WRITINGS. SAM ADAMS~ A CIA ANALYST~ WHO FOUGHT THE CIA AT EVERY STEP~ SAID THE AGENCY IN UNDERCOUNTING THE VC REFUSED TO USE WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ITS PRIMARY SOURCE -- CAPTURED ENEMY DOCUMENTS. IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE I DISCOVERED THAT THE CIA BURIED ANY INFORMATION THAT DID NOT SUPPORT ITS PRO-WAR POLICIES. THE CIA RECRUITED PAID AGENTS TO TELL IT WHAT IT WANTED TO HEAR~ IGNORING THE MASS OF OVERT INFORMATION THAT SO DISPROVED ITS RATIONALES FOR THE WAR.

BOOK REVIEW,VIETNAM~ @60-75@ WAR OF NUMBERS: AN INTEL MEMOIR~ BY SAM ADAMS~ 1994. SAMUEL A. ADAMS BECAME AN ANALYST FOR CIA IN 64~ WORKING ON THE CONGO. HE SHIFTED IN 65 TO THE SOUTHEAST ASIA BRANCH~ AND WAS ASSIGNED TO STUDY VIETCONG MORALE. HE SOON PUZZLED. THE NUMBER OF DEFECTORS AND DESERTERS FROM COMMUNIST FORCES WAS QUITE LARGE. TAKEN AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL PERSONNEL IN SOUTH VIETNAM~ ESTIMATED AT SLIGHTLY LESS THAN 300~000 IN THE ORDER OF BATTLE REPORTS COMPILED BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS IN SAIGON~ IT SEEMED SO LARGE AS TO SUGGEST AN ORGANIZATION IN COLLAPSE. COMBAT PERFORMANCE OF THE COMMUNISTS~ HOWEVER~ DID NOT SUGGEST COLLAPSE. PARADOX WAS RESOLVED WHEN ADAMS DISCOVERED OB FIGURES WERE WRONG; THERE WERE ACTUALLY ABOUT 600~000 COMMUNIST PERSONNEL IN SOUTH VIETNAM. PROBLEM HAD NOT ORIGINATED FROM DISHONESTY. THERE WERE LARGE COMPONENTS OF THE COMMUNIST FORCE STRUCTURE THAT U.S. INTEL SIMPLY HAD NOT STUDIED ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE RELIABLE FIGURES. BY THE FIRST HALF OF 1967~ THE NECESSARY STUDIES WERE BEING COMPLETED AND THE MILITARY INTEL OFFICERS IN SAIGON WERE READY TO RAISE THE OB FIGURE. THEY WERE FORBIDDEN TO DO SO. AT A SERIES OF CONFERENCES FROM JUNE TO SEPTEMBER 1967~ ADAMS AND CIA ARGUED FOR REALISTIC FIGURES~ WHILE MILITARY INTEL OFFICERS WERE REQUIRED BY THEIR SUPERIORS TO ARGUE FOR LOW FIGURES. THE MILITARY WON; THE TOTAL FIGURE IN THE OB WAS LOWERED INSTEAD OF BEING RAISED. THIS WAS ACHIEVED PARTLY BY DROPPING THE VIETCONG VILLAGE MILITIA~ AND PARTLY BY UNDERESTIMATION (BY THIS TIME REFLECTING OUTRIGHT DISHONESTY) OF SEVERAL OTHER CATEGORIES. ADAMS PROTESTED CIA'S DECISION TO ACCEPT MILITARY'S FIGURES AND BECAME A SERIOUS NUISANCE. HE WAS SHIFTED TO WORKING ON CAMBODIA~ WHERE HE FOUND THAT OFFICIAL ESTIMATES OF KHMER ROUGE WERE ALSO FAR TOO LOW. HE QUIT CIA IN DISGUST IN 1973~ AND BEGAN WRITING HIS MEMOIRS. HIS CLAIMS BECAME THE BASIS FOR A CBS DOCUMENTARY BROADCAST IN 1982. GENERAL WESTMORELAND SUED FOR LIBEL. BEFORE WESTMORELAND DROPPED HIS SUIT~ IT HAD PRODUCED A FLOOD OF NEW INFO - DECLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AND TESTIMONY FROM MILITARY AND CIVILIAN INTEL PERSONNEL--MUCH OF IT STRONGLY CONFIRMING ADAMS' CHARGES AND MUCH OF IT NEW TO HIM. THIS BOOK FALLS FAR SHORT OF WHAT MANY PEOPLE EXPECTED. IT IS STILL VERY GOOD. HIS ANALYSIS OF THE REASONS THE COMMUNISTS ACHIEVED TET SURPRISE~ FOR EXAMPLE~ IS FAR BETTER THAN THAT IN THE RECENT ^THE TET OFFENSIVE: INTEL FAILURE IN WAR^~ BY J.

BOOK REVIEW,VIETNAM~ @60-96@ BOOK~ ROBERT MCNAMARA AND FIVE LIVES OF A LOST WAR~ BY JAMES G. HERSHBERG REVIEWED BY PAUL HENDRICKSON - KNOPF. BOOK IS A DEEPLY INFORMED~ INSIGHTFUL~ PROFOUNDLY AMBIVALENT YET ULTIMATELY PIERCING CHARACTER STUDY~ ONE THAT DOES MUCH TO ELUCIDATE AND EXPOSE ITS ALOOF AND ENDLESSLY CONTRADICTORY CENTRAL FIGURE. IN 1960~ THE NATION -- AND JOHN F. KENNEDY -- ONLY SAW MCNAMARA'S BEST AND BRIGHTEST SIDE: THE ULTRA-COMPETENT~ SUPER-EFFICIENT NEW FORD PRESIDENT WITH A NONCONFORMIST BENT THAT APPEALED TO TALENT SCOUTS RECRUITING GLITTERY ^ACTION INTELLECTUALS^ TO SERVE THE NEW PRESIDENT. WITH JOHNSON VIETNAM BEGAN TO GO SOUR~ AND THE FIGURES STOPPED ADDING UP. THE CORE OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD IS A NUANCED~ DRAMATIC RECOUNTING OF THE 1965-67 PERIOD~ OF MCNAMARA'S INTERNAL STRUGGLES (BOTH WITHIN THE JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION AND WITHIN HIMSELF) OVER VIETNAM POLICY. HERE THE AUTHOR BRINGS ONSTAGE FIVE CHARACTERS WHOSE LIVES WERE FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERED BY THE WAR~ WHO IN EFFECT SERVE AS FOILS TO THE BOOK'S ANTI-HERO~ EACH IN HIS OR HER OWN WAY HAVING TRANSCENDED THE CONSTRICTING SHACKLES OF HISTORY TO ATTAIN A KIND OF GRACE OR RESOLUTION THAT MCNAMARA NEVER ACHIEVED. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE FIVE PERSONS EXAMINED IS NORMAN R. MORRISON~ WHO IMMOLATED HIMSELF IN PROTEST AGAINST THE WIDENING WAR UNDER MCNAMARA'S PENTAGON WINDOW IN THE GATHERING DUSK ON NOVEMBER 2~ 1965. PRECISELY BECAUSE HENDRICKSON'S EMPATHY DOES NOT EXCLUDE SYMPATHY THAT HIS ULTIMATE VERDICT IS SO DAMNING. ADDING UP (AS OTHERS HAVE DONE) THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS KILLED AND WOUNDED DURING MCNAMARA'S PERIOD OF ^VEILED DISBELIEF^ (93~000)~ HENDRICKSON CONDEMNS HIM FOR FAILING TO RESIGN IN PROTEST OR SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY AT A TIME ^WHEN HIS VOICE AND DECISION TO TELL THE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE CHANGED HISTORY AND SAVED THOUSANDS^ -- A LAPSE THE AUTHOR ATTRIBUTES TO A FATAL MIXTURE OF AMBITION~ POWER-CRAVING AND A MORAL FAILURE OF NERVE~ ALL ADDING UP TO A ^TRAGIC FLAW OF CHARACTER.^ MCNAMARA~ HENDRICKSON CONCLUDES~ ^WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY IMPRESSIVE PERSON~ ALMOST A NEW ADAM~ WHO ABUSED HIS TRUST~ AND KNOWS HE DID~ AND SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE PAYING FOR IT.^ <WPBW 9/15/96 1~10

BOOK REVIEW,VIETNAM~ @70-99@ VICTORIES AND FINAL TRAGEDY OF AMERICA'S LAST YEARS IN VIETNAM BY LEWIS SORLEY. REVIEWED BY ARNOLD R. ISAACS. LEWIS SORLEY [HAS] TWO MISSIONS IN THIS BOOK. THE FIRST~ WHICH HE LARGELY ACHIEVES~ IS TO RESCUE GEN. CREIGHTON ABRAMS'S REPUTATION FROM THE WRECK OF VIETNAM. THE SECOND IS TO REEVALUATE THE U.S. CAMPAIGN AS A SUCCESS. SORLEY MAKES A CASE THAT ABRAMS WAS A BETTER COMMANDER THAN WESTMORELAND~ WHOSE ILL-CONCEIVED WAR OF ATTRITION IN 1965-68 HAD~ ^SQUANDERED FOUR YEARS OF PUBLIC AND CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE WAR.^ ABRAMS ADOPTED A STRATEGY THAT MADE PROTECTING PEOPLE AND VILLAGES THE FIRST PRIORITY. WITH THIS POLICY CHANGE~ ABRAMS AND TWO KEY CIVILIAN OFFICIALS -- CIA'S WILLIAM COLBY~ WHO HEADED THE PACIFICATION PROGRAM~ AND AMBASSADOR BUNKER -- TURNED A MILITARY FAILURE INTO A SUCCESS. SORLEY~ A RETIRED ARMY OFFICER AND FORMER CIA OFFICIAL~ USES EVIDENCE SELECTIVELY~ TO SAY THE LEAST. NOT A WORD ABOUT THE TOLL OF CIVILIAN DEATHS IN AREAS OCCUPIED BY THE 9TH INFANTRY DIVISION~ WHICH BECAME A WHISPERED SCANDAL AMONG MANY OFFICERS IN THE U.S. COMMAND. THIS IS SPIN~ NOT HISTORY. SORLEY FOCUSES ON U.S. POLICIES AND ACTIONS~ HE PAYS ONLY GLANCING ATTENTION TO THE VIETNAMESE. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE SIDE IS MENTIONED ONLY BRIEFLY AND SUPERFICIALLY; ABOUT THE COMMUNISTS~ SORLEY SAYS VIRTUALLY NOTHING. THE VIETNAMESE WERE JUST PART OF THE SCENERY. <WP 8/8/99 X8
