SUCH GOVERNMENT CONDUITS AS AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (AID)~ NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY (NED)~ CONGRESS ITSELF AND CIA SUPPLIED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO IAD. IAD USED THESE FUNDS TO FINANCE COVERT OPS TO SABOTAGE PROGRESSIVE~ LEFT-WING~ SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST-LED UNIONS OPPOSED TO U.S. POLICIES. ALONG WITH FREE TRADE UNION INSTITUTE~ IAD SET UP DUMMY UNIONS WITH PAPER MEMBERSHIP AND HIRED ANTI-COMMUNIST ^LABOR LEADERS^ TO CREATE DUAL UNIONS. THESE ^UNIONS^ ARE SUBSERVIENT TO U.S. TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS THAT CONTINUE TO PAUPERIZE AND OPPRESS THIRD WORLD WORKERS. AIFLD BACKED RIGHTISTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. IAD WAS DIVIDED INTO GLOBAL SECTORS. BEST KNOWN WAS NOTORIOUS AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR FREE LABOR DEPARTMENT. IT FOCUSED ON COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
