BUILDING 61 ON THE SAME COMPOUND WAS USED AS THE AMERICAN COMMUNICATIONS AREA (AMCA) WHICH WAS ALSO STAFFED BY CIA OFFICE OF COMMUNICATIONS. THIS FACILITY SERVED TO PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO OC/MIAMI AND TO OTHER OFFICE OF COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA AND SOUTH AMERICA. IN 1985 CIA FORMED A WHOLLY-OWNED PROPRIETARY COMPANY CALLED THE RELOCATION FUNDING COMPANY OF AMERICA (TRFCA) TO PROVIDE RELOCATION SERVICES TO CIA EMPLOYEES. 5/12/97 KSTAHL@NR.INFI.NET

CIA EXPANDING NOC PROGRAM - SEVERAL HUNDRED NOW IN FIELD AND NUMBERS GROWING. ONLY TOP LEVEL OFFICIALS OF COMPANIES KNOW IDENTITY OF CIA NOC OFFICERS. HANDLING TAX RETURNS. TO RECRUIT NOCS~ CIA USES FRONT COMPANIES AND PLACES ADDS IN MAJOR NEWSPAPERS. CIA'S OFFICE OF CENTRAL COVER MUST ASSIGN A STAFF MEMBER TO HANDLE NOC OFFICER'S PERSONAL AFFAIRS. NOC OFFICERS IN COLOMBIA WOUNDED OR KILLED IN GUNFIGHTS WITH DRUG SMUGGLERS. A NOC OFFICER IN AFRICA WAS BEATEN AND JAILED FOR A MONTH. NOC OFFICERS HAVE MORE LUCK IN HARD TARGETS SUCH AS IRAN~ IRAQ AND NORTH KOREA. CIA EXPERIMENTING WITH SETTING UP TWO STATIONS IN COUNTRIES. MORALE AT CIA AT ROCKBOTTOM. YOUNG CASE OFFICERS DEMANDING HOUSECLEANING OF TOP OFFICIALS OF OPS DIRECTORATE. 12/94 CIA SETTLED A LAWSUIT WITH JAMAICAN STATION CHIEF JANINE BROOKNER FOR 410~000 PLUS LAWYERS FEES. <TIME 2/20/95 28

NEW ROUTES OF ACCESS HAVE TO BE FOUND TO NEW SUBJECTS OF WEAPONS PROLIFERATION~ ECONOMIC INTEL~ TERRORISM AND NARCOTICS. DRUG LORDS ARE NOT INVITED TO DIPLOMATIC RECEPTIONS. <USNWR 7/4/94 46
COVER,@90-95@ MORE OF THE SPIES BEING RECRUITED TODAY ARE NOCS (NON-OFFICIAL COVER) RATHER THAN DIPLOMATIC CORPS. FOR PAST FOUR YEARS~ CIA HAS BEEN QUIETLY EXPANDING ITS NOC PROGRAM~ PLACING UNDERCOVER OFFICERS IN U.S. BUSINESSES OVERSEAS. DURING COLD WAR~ CIA CASE OFFICERS UNDER EMBASSY COVER COULD CRUISE FOREIGN MINISTRIES AND COCKTAIL PARTIES TO COLLECT INTEL ON THE USSR. TO PENETRATE NEW THREATS~ LIKE TERRORISM~ DRUGS~ ECONOMIC INTEL UNCONVENTIONAL COVERS ARE NEEDED SO THE CIA CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS NOC PROGRAM. INTEL OFFICIALS SAY SEVERAL HUNDRED NOCS ARE NOW IN THE FIELD~ AND NUMBER IS GROWING. SENIOR OFFICIALS FROM AGENCY'S NATIONAL COLLECTIONS BRANCH HAVE BEEN QUIETLY APPROACHING BUSINESSES DOING OVERSEAS WORK TO ASK IF THEY WILL PROVIDE COVERS FOR CIA CASE OFFICERS. ENERGY COMPANIES~ IMPORT-EXPORT FIRMS~ MULTINATIONAL CONCERNS~ BANKS WITH FOREIGN BRANCHES AND HIGH-TECH CORPORATIONS ARE AMONG THOSE BEING APPROACHED. USUALLY THE COMPANY PRESIDENT AND PERHAPS ANOTHER SENIOR OFFICER~ SUCH AS THE GENERAL COUNSEL~ ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO KNOW OF ARRANGEMENT. <TIME 2/20/95
COVER,@90-95@ OFFICIALS SAY THAT NOC (NON-OFFICIAL COVER) OFFICERS OVERSEAS CAN BE FOUR TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS ASSIGNING OFFICERS UNDER AN EMBASSY COVER. ELABORATE CLANDESTINE COMMUNICATIONS MUST BE ESTABLISHED SO NOC OFFICER CAN PASS HIS INTEL. CIA'S OFFICE OF CENTRAL COVER MUST ASSIGN A STAFF MEMBER TO HANDLE A NOC OFFICER'S PERSONAL AFFAIRS AND KEEP HIS REAL-LIFE BILLS PAID WHILE HE LEADS HIS COVER LIFE. COMPANIES PROVIDING COVER ARE UNDERSTANDABLY SKITTISH ABOUT HAVING IT BLOWN. TIME CONTACTED HALF A DOZEN FORTUNE 500 FIRMS TO ASK IF THEY ACCEPTED NOC OFFICERS. MOST EITHER REFUSED TO COMMENT OR SAID THEY DO NOT PARTICIPATE. NOC WORK CAN TAKE ITS TOLL ON THE CASE OFFICER AS WELL. NOC OFFICERS CANNOT COUNT ON JUST BEING EXPELLED FROM COUNTRIES LIKE OFFICERS WITH DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY. NOC OFFICERS IN COLOMBIA WHO HAVE SET UP IMPORT-EXPORT COMPANIES AS COVERS -- BRIBING DRUG COURIERS FOR INTEL -- HAVE BEEN WOUNDED OR KILLED IN GUNFIGHTS WITH TRAFFICKERS. A NOC OFFICER SERVING IN AFRICA WAS BEATEN UP AND JAILED FOR A MONTH. ANOTHER~ GRABBED BY A HIZBALLAH FACTION IN BEIRUT~ MANAGED TO TALK HIS WAY OUT BY CONVINCING HIS FUNDAMENTALIST CAPTORS THAT HE WAS A U.S. NARCOTICS AGENT FIGHTING EVIL DRUGS. YOU'VE GOT TO BE YOUR OWN LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEM~ SAYS JOHN F. QUINN~ WHO ONCE WORKED AS A NOC OFFICER IN JAPAN COLLECTING ECONOMIC INTEL. YOU'RE OUT IN THE COLD. YOU'RE ALONE. YOU HAVE TO BE A TIGHTROPE WALKER ALL THE TIME~ BALANCING YOUR CORPORATE JOB~ YOUR INTEL JOB AND YOUR MENTAL SANITY. CIA BELIEVES NOCS ARE THE BEST WAY TO CARRY OUT MANY CLANDESTINE OPS. SERVICES USUALLY HAVE NO TROUBLE SPOTTING CIA OFFICERS OPERATING UNDER AN EMBASSY'S COVER. NOT SO FOR NOCS. IF YOU'RE WORKING DRUGS~ THUGS OR TECH TRANSFERS~ YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN BANKS ALL THE TIME LOOKING AT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS -- JOBS OFTEN BETTER SUITED FOR AN OFFICER UNDER CORPORATE COVER. NOC OFFICERS ALSO HAVE HAD MORE LUCK SPYING ON HARD TARGETS SUCH AS IRAN~ IRAQ AND NORTH KOREA~ WHERE U.S. HAS NO EMBASSIES IN WHICH TO HIDE CIA OPERATIVES. CIA IS EVEN EXPERIMENTING WITH SETTING UP TWO STATIONS IN SOME COUNTRIES. ONE WOULD BE UNDER THE TRADITIONAL EMBASSY COVER~ WHILE ANOTHER MUCH MORE SECRETIVE STATION WOULD HANDLE THE NOCS. <TIME 2/20/95

COVER,@99@ AT CIA STATIONS OVERSEAS~ CIA CASE OFFICERS OFTEN STAND OUT LIKE SORE THUMBS EASILY FOLLOWED BY FOREIGN CI PER BRIAN P. FAIRCHILD~ A FORMER CASE OFFICER IN CIA'S DIRECTORATE OF OPS (DO). IT DOESN'T TAKE FOREIGN INTEL LONG TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ^THIRD SECRETARIES^ IN STATE'S POLITICAL SECTION ARE ACTUALLY CIA CASE OFFICERS [AND THEREFORE] IT DOESN'T TAKE THEM LONG TO FIGURE OUT WHICH FOREIGN OFFICIALS CIA IS TRYING TO RECRUIT. FAIRCHILD~ WHO RETIRED IN 1995 AFTER NUMEROUS OVERSEAS POSTINGS~ INCLUDING A STINT AS A NON-OFFICIAL COVER (NOC) OFFICER~ FIRST WARNED CONGRESS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. ^IN TWO LARGE STATIONS TO WHICH I WAS ASSIGNED~ ONE IN ASIA AND THE OTHER IN EUROPE~ THE LOCAL CI SERVICE MADE IT KNOWN THAT IT WAS AWARE~ ALMOST TO A MAN~ OF THE NUMBER OF DO UNDERCOVER OFFICERS IN THE EMBASSY~^ PER FAIRCHILD. FAIRCHILD REPEATED HIS CONCERNS AFTER READING CLAIMS BY CIA'S NEW DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR OPS~ JAMES L. PAVITT~ WHO SAID THE DO IS ON THE MEND TWO YEARS INTO AN REBUILDING CAMPAIGN. THE DO'S CI AND OPS SECURITY PROBLEMS ARE SO DEEP THEY WILL TAKE FAR LONGER THAN TWO YEARS TO FIX. ^BUT IF YOU MADE A MOVIE OF THE REAL ASPECTS OF THE JOB~ IT WOULD BE A COMEDY...^ <WP 9/21/99
COVER,@99@ JAMES L. PAVITT THE NEW DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR OPS HAS MORE MONEY TO HIRE NEW SPIES [UNDER EITHER] ^OFFICIAL COVER^ OR ^NON-OFFICIAL COVER - ^NOCS.^ CRITICS ARGUE ONLY NOCS CAN GET CLOSE TO SUCH TARGETS AS TERRORIST GROUPS~ ETC. BUT NOCS OFTEN CREATE MORE PROBLEMS THAN THEY SOLVE. THEY'RE EXPENSIVE~ AND FOR LIAISON WITH FOREIGN SERVICES AND DEFECTORS~ OFFICIAL COVER IS BETTER. NOCS REQUIRE SEPARATE TRAINING AND A NOC BUREAUCRACY. EXECUTIVES OF SOME BIG U.S. COMPANIES [ARE RELUCTANT] TO SHELTER THEM. IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY~ U.S.-BASED COMPANIES OFTEN HAVE FOREIGN-BORN [OFFICERS]. SUCH OFTEN CONSIDER THEMSELVES CITIZENS OF THE WORLD~ AND NOT PROVIDERS OF COVER FOR U.S. SPIES. NOCS DO NOT HAVE THE PROTECTION OF DIPLOMATIC STATUS. <WP 12/12/99 B9
COVER,@99@ USIA AND THE CIA~ CONCERNS WITHIN THE U.S. INFORMATION AGENCY THAT CIA MIGHT BEGIN USING USIA POSTS OVERSEAS AS COVER FOR COVERT AGENTS ONCE THE AGENCY FOLDS INTO THE STATE DEPARTMENT LATER THIS YEAR. USE OF USIA POSITIONS FOR YEARS HAS BEEN EXPLICITLY OUT-OF-BOUNDS FOR THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY TO PROTECT THE CREDIBILITY OF ITS OFFICERS. NO SUCH PROTECTION EXISTS FOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS. THE ISSUE HAS BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT~ BUT NO DECISION HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED. BUT FORMER CIA DIRECTOR ROBERT M. GATES SAID~ ^IF IT'S NOT CLEARLY STATED~ IT DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE.^ STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN JAMES P.

COVERT A,IRAQ~ @94-96@ THE IRAQI NATIONAL CONGRESS IN EARLY 1995 (INC) WAS FUNDED AND BACKED BY THE CIA AS AN UMBRELLA GROUP OF KURDISH FACTIONS AND OTHER DISSIDENTS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF AHMAD CHALABI~ A U.S.-EDUCATED IRAQI SHIITE LEADER. BUT THE U.S. SAW INC OPS IN N. IRAQ AS AN EFFORT TO HARASS THE IRAQI REGIME AND~ IN DOZENS OF SMALL WAYS~ MAKE LIFE DIFFICULT FOR HUSSEIN. WITH A NEWSPAPER~ RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS AND OTHER PROPAGANDA AND POLITICAL EFFORTS~ THE OPERATION SERVED AS A DAILY REMINDER TO HUSSEIN THAT HE DID NOT CONTROL ALL OF IRAQI TERRITORY. IN ADDITION~ THE INC~ PROTECTED BY A U.S.-PATROLLED ^NO-FLY^ ZONE IN NORTHERN IRAQ~ PROVIDED A HAVEN FOR WOULD-BE IRAQI DEFECTORS AND ALLOWED THE U.S. TO CLAIM THAT IT WAS SUPPORTING A DEMOCRATIC ALTERNATIVE TO HUSSEIN'S REGIME. BUT THE INC WAS RIVEN BY BITTER INFIGHTING BETWEEN THE RIVAL KURDISH FACTIONS. A NEW CIA TEAM FOUND THAT IN NORTHERN IRAQ~ THE INC WAS EAGER TO MOVE. THE CIA'S NEW TEAM LEADER KNOWN AS ^BOB^ TOLD CHALABI. ^HE WAS WASTING OUR MONEY AND TIME....^ ^BOB^ RECALLED IN AN INTERVIEW. BUT HE RECEIVED NO INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH CHALABI'S SEPARATE PLAN FOR A LARGE-SCALE MILITARY OFFENSIVE AGAINST IRAQI ARMY UNITS. BOB'S TEAM ENCOURAGED INC LEADERS TO ACT.

BOB SOLD BARZANI ON PARTICIPATING BY SUGGESTING THAT THE U.S. WOULD PROVIDE AIR COVER. BOB DENIED THAT CLAIM~ AS WELL AS OTHER ASSERTIONS BY CHALABI AND THE KURDISH FACTIONS THAT HE FAILED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE U.S. WOULD NOT PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE. CHALABI URGED IRANIAN-BACKED DISSIDENT GROUPS IN SOUTHERN IRAQ TO SUPPORT HIS OFFENSIVE WITH AN ATTACK ON THE IRAQI ARMY FROM THE SOUTH. TWO IRANIAN INTEL OFFICERS AND SEVERAL MEMBERS OF AN IRANIAN-BACKED DISSIDENT GROUP IN S. IRAQ ARRIVED AT CHALABI'S HQS. BOB SUPPOSEDLY TOLD CHALABI TO TELL THE IRANIAN AGENTS THAT THE U.S. WOULD NOT OPPOSE IRANIAN SUPPORT. THUS BARZANI'S FACTION BOWED OUT OF CHALABI'S OFFENSIVE~ BUT CHALABI AND THE PUK SENT AS MANY AS 15~000 TROOPS INTO COMBAT IN EARLY MARCH 1995. THE REBELS WON SOME LOCAL VICTORIES AND CRIPPLED SEVERAL IRAQI UNITS BEFORE THE ASSAULT FALTERED LATER THAT MONTH. THE COALITION WAS FORCED TO SCATTER THE NEXT YEAR. LOS ANGELES TIMES 2/15/98 A1
