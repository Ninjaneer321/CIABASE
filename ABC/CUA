CIA WORKED CLOSELY WITH CHILE'S SECRET POLICE IN THE 1970S~ AT THE TIME OF THE PINOCHET REGIME'S WORST HUMAN-RIGHTS ABUSES~ WHICH INCLUDED MORE THAN 3~000 KILLINGS. MANY OF THE ACTIONS OF THE U.S. DURING THE 1973 COUP~ AND MUCH OF WHAT AMERICAN LEADERS AND INTEL SERVICES DID IN LIAISON WITH THE PINOCHET GOVT AFTER IT SEIZED POWER~ ARE STILL SECRET. FILES ON THE PINOCHET REGIME ARE HELD BY CIA~ DIA~ STATE~ THE PENTAGON~ NSC~ NATIONAL ARCHIVES~ AND PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARIES OF FORD AND CARTER.

ALPIREZ~ A MEMBER OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE ON AGENCY'S PAYROLL~ ORDERED MURDER OF A U.S. CITIZEN~ WILLIAM DEVINE~ AND THEN TORTURE-MURDER OF HUSBAND OF AN AMERICAN WOMAN. WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS~ AND PRES. CLINTON IN PARTICULAR~ WERE VERY ANGRY ABOUT GUATEMALAN AFFAIR BUT NSC ANTHONY LAKE WAS ARGUING THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT CIA TRIED TO DECEIVE PRESIDENT. LOS ANGELES TIMES REPORTED THAT LATE LAST YEAR STATE DEPT FOUND INFO ABOUT DEVINE MURDER IN ITS FILES THAT APPEARED TO HAVE ORIGINATED WITH CIA AND HAD NOT BEEN PASSED ON TO WHITE HOUSE. THIS DISCOVERY PROMPTED STATE DEPARTMENT AND WHITE HOUSE TO ASK CIA FOR MORE INFO. STATE INITIALLY ASKED CIA FOR INFO ON REBEL COMMANDANTE EFRAIN BAMACA VELASQUEZ AND RECEIVED A FEW MODEST FILES. SEVERAL WEEKS LATER~ STATE AGAIN ASKED CIA FOR INFO BUT THIS TIME ON ^COMMANDANTE EVERARDO~^ WHICH WAS COMMANDANTE BAMACA'S WELL-KNOWN NOM DE GUERRE.

ALPIREZ~ WAS PRESENT AT KILLING IN 1990 OF DEVINE~ A U.S. CITIZEN WHO RAN A POPULAR TOURIST RESORT IN GUATEMALA. CIA INSISTED TO THE PAPER THAT IT CUT TIES WITH COLONEL AT THAT POINT~ BUT~ SIGNIFICANTLY~ SOURCES DID NOT PUT A DATE ON RUPTURE. THAT GAVE IT ^WIGGLE ROOM^ TO SAY IT DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT COLONEL'S INVOLVEMENT IN MARCH 1992 TORTURE-MURDER OF BAMACA UNTIL EARLY THIS YEAR. CIA GAVE COL.

THE BOOK CONTAINED 29 NAMES~ AS WELL AS 40 ASTERISKS FOR AGENCY PEOPLE WHO~ HAD TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. GUP INTERVIEWED 400 PAST AND PRESENT CIA OFFICERS~ THE FAMILIES OF THE FALLEN~ AND CHASED LEADS AROUND THE WORLD. THIS IS A MASTERFUL INVESTIGATIVE REPORT~ WITH ILLUMINATING SPY STORIES. IN 1949-50~ DOUGLAS MACKIERNAN~ A CIA OFFICER POSING AS A STATE OFFICER IN A REMOTE WESTERN REGION OF CHINA~ FLEEING THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS. HE HAD BEEN ASSISTING THE LOCAL ANTI-COMMUNIST RESISTANCE. MACKIERNAN WAS BUT HUNDREDS OF YARDS FROM SAFETY WHEN TIBETAN SOLDIERS KILLED HIM. HUGH REDMOND~ A CIA OFFICER~ WAS ARRESTED IN 1951 IN SHANGHAI~ WHERE HE HAD BEEN SUPPORTING ANTI-COMMUNIST SABOTEURS. HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN SUCH RISKY ACTION~ EVEN THOUGH A CIA ANALYSIS HAD CONCLUDED THAT ^NO BASIS FOR A SUCCESSFUL COUNTER-REVOLUTION IS APPARENT.^ REDMOND WAS KEPT IN A CHINESE PRISON FOR 19 YEARS. THE U.S. DENIED HE WAS A SPY AND~ INSTEAD~ EXPLOITED HIM~ ACCUSING THE CHINESE OF JAILING AN INNOCENT. IN 1970~ REDMOND KILLED HIMSELF WITH A RAZOR. THOMAS WILLARD RAY~ ONE OF DOZENS OF ALABAMA GUARDSMEN RECRUITED TO HELP WITH THE BAY OF PIGS INVASION OF CUBA IN 1961~ WAS KILLED. THE U.S. SLANDERED RAY AND OTHER GUARDSMEN LOST BY BRANDING THEM SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE. JOHN MERRIMAN~ A PILOT FOR A CIA FRONT~ WAS SHOT DOWN IN THE CONGO IN 1964. HE WAS BADLY INJURED~ BUT THE CIA WAS MORE CONCERNED WITH APPEARANCES--NO AMERICANS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE COMBAT THERE--THAN WITH MERRIMAN'S CONDITION. IT TOOK DAYS TO AIRLIFT HIM TO A POORLY EQUIPPED HOSPITAL~ WHERE HE LANGUISHED FOR WEEKS. HE DIED ON A FLIGHT BACK TO AMERICA. IT WAS 30 YEARS BEFORE HIS WIDOW LEARNED THE FULL DETAILS OF HIS DEATH. MATTHEW GANNON~ A CIA OFFICER~ WAS ON PAN AM FLIGHT 103 WHEN THE AIRLINER WAS BLOWN UP OVER SCOTLAND. GANNON'S FATHER-IN-LAW~ THOMAS TWETTEN~ HAD HELPED SELECT TARGETS FOR THAT RAID. CIA DOES NOT FARE WELL IN HIS ACCOUNT. TOO OFTEN~ IT TREATED ITS PEOPLE AND THEIR SURVIVORS SHABBILY. TOO OFTEN~ IT MOUNTED OPS THAT DID MORE HARM THAN GOOD: THE BAY OF PIGS~ THE SECRET WAR IN LAOS.
