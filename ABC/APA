WHEN BUDGE WILLIAMS AND TWO OTHER GREEN BERETS EXECUTED A SUSPECTED NORTH VIETNAMESE SPY IN 1969~ THEY WERE ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH MURDER. BUT 15 YEARS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS HAVE PROVOKED NOSTALGIA FOR EXECUTIVE ACTION. THE U.S. NEVER GAVE UP ITS CAPABILITY TO ASSASSINATE. AFTER THE 444-DAY IRANIAN HOSTAGE ORDEAL~ THE UNITED STATES GOT SERIOUS ABOUT ITS COMMANDO UNITS. DELTA TEAMS~ NAVY SEALS~ AIR COMMANDOS~ AND ARMY GREEN BERETS - WERE RETOOLED TO HANDLE A WIDER RANGE OF MISSIONS~ INCLUDING ^SNATCHES^ AND ASSASSINATIONS OF TERRORISTS. IN 1991~ ^I SAW A VIDEOTAPE PRESENTATION THAT OUTLINES U.S. CAPABILITIES - BY DEEP-LEVEL GREEN BERET UNITS - TO CARRY OUT ASSASSINATION~^ SAYS A FORMER CIA OFFICER~ WHO APPROVES OF HAVING THE CAPABILITY.

BELGIUM TROOPS ARRIVED TO RESTORE ORDER~ AND PATRICE LUMUMBA THREATENED TO INVITE SOVIET TROOPS TO FORCE OUT THE BELGIAN FORCES. AT AN 8/18/60 SPECIAL GROUP MEETING OF THE NSC~ EISENHOWER REMARKED THAT IT WAS TIME TO ^GET RID OF LUMUMBA.^ WITHOUT A SPECIFIC ASSASSINATION ORDER~ THE CIA USED A 1947 NATIONAL SECURITY DIRECTIVE TO ELIMINATE LUMUMBA. THE DOMINO THEORY WAS IN EFFECT: IF THE CONGO FELL TO COMMUNISM~ ALL AFRICA WOULD GO COMMUNIST. A CIA PROJECT~ CODE NAMED MKNAOMI STARTED IN 1952 AT THE US ARMY'S BIOLOGICAL WARFARE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER~ FT. DETRICK~ MARYLAND. ARMY'S SPECIAL OPS DEPARTMENT (SOD) DEVELOPED~ TESTED~ AND MAINTAINED OFFENSIVE OR ^FIRST USE^ BIOLOGICAL AGENTS AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR THE CIA. THEY HAD ALSO DEVELOPED DISSOLVABLE PILLS CONTAINING SEVERAL BIOLOGICAL AGENTS THAT COULD REMAIN POTENT FOR WEEKS OR MONTHS~ AND DART GUNS AND DARTS COATED WITH BIOLOGICAL AGENTS. FEW AT THE CIA KNEW ABOUT IT. CIA SCIENTISTS WHO WORKED WITH THE ARMY WERE IDENTIFIED AS MILITARY OFFICERS OF THE ^STAFF SUPPORT GROUP.^ IN 9/60~ GOTTLIEB~ WHO HAD WORKED WITH SOD~ RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS TO GO TO FORT DETRICK AND SELECT A TOXIN THAT WOULD BE USED IN THE ASSASSINATION PLANS TO KILL LUMUMBA. THE VIRUS FROM THESE TOXINS INCLUDED TULAREMIA (RABBIT FEVER)~ BRUCELLOSIS (UNDULANT FEVER)~ TUBERCULOSIS~ ANTHRAX~ SMALLPOX~ AND VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS (SLEEPING SICKNESS). THE TOXIN CHOSEN WAS TO PRODUCE A FATAL DISEASE INDIGENOUS TO THE CONGO. GOTTLIEB FLEW TO LEOPOLDVILLE~ CONGO~ USING THE ALIAS ^JOSEPH BRAUN^ AND IDENTIFIED HIMSELF TO THE STATION OFFICER AS ^JOE FROM PARIS.^ HE GAVE THE STATION OFFICER A TOXIC BIOLOGICAL SUBSTANCE~ HYPODERMIC NEEDLES~ RUBBER GLOVES AND GAUZE MASKS. HE INSTRUCTED THE STATION OFFICER TO ^SECURELY MOUNT AN OP TO EITHER SERIOUSLY INCAPACITATE OR ELIMINATE LUMUMBA.^ THE IDEA WAS TO HAVE AN AGENT GET CLOSE TO ^BIG BROTHER^ (LUMUMBA) AND PLACE THE TOXIN IN HIS FOOD OR TOOTHPASTE. THE MATERIALS WERE STORED IN THE STATION OFFICER'S SAFE. GOTTLIEB LATER TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS~ BEFORE LEAVING~ HE DUMPED THE UNUSED TOXIN INTO THE CONGO RIVER AFTER DESTROYING ^THE VIABILITY OF THE BACTERIOLOGICAL MATERIAL.^ RIVAL POLITICAL FORCES ASSASSINATED LUMUMBA IN JANUARY 1961.

TARGETING BY COALITION AIRCRAFT DURING THE GULF WAR~ SHOWED THAT 580 COMMAND AND CONTROL TARGETS WERE HIT AND ANOTHER 260 WERE CONSIDERED LEADERSHIP TARGETS~ INCLUDING SADDAM'S PALACES AND OTHER BUILDINGS HE HAD BEEN KNOWN TO FREQUENT. EARLIER QUESTIONS AROSE WHEN A GROUP OF PANAMANIAN OFFICERS SOUGHT SUPPORT AND LETHAL WEAPONS FOR THEIR ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE NORIEGA AND EXILE HIM FROM THEIR COUNTRY. THE CIA WITHHELD ITS SUPPORT~ AND THE COUP FAILED. ONE OF THE COVERT ACTIONS AGAINST SADDAM IN THE 1994-1995 PERIOD WAS THE ^ZIPLESS COUP^ AIMED AT REMOVING THE IRAQI LEADER. THE PLOTTING INVOLVED SUPPORTING EXILED IRAQI MILITARY AND POLITICAL LEADERS WHO OPERATED FROM AMMAN~ JORDAN. ANOTHER EXCEPTION TO THE NO-ASSASSINATION POLICY WAS DISCUSSED IN THE LATE 1980S IN THE WAKE OF THE BOMBING OF THE U.S. EMBASSY IN LEBANON. THE TOPIC: ^WHAT ARE THE RULES IN PLOTTING TO KILL TERRORISTS?^ AN INFORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES WAS THAT IF A COVERT ACTION TARGETED A TERRORIST IN HIS APARTMENT PLOTTING TO BLOW UP A BUILDING~ HE HAD TO BE DETAINED.

IN THE LATE 1940S~ OSI ANALYZED AND DISSEMINATED FOREIGN SCIENTIFIC~ AND MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE CONCERNING THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF ATOMIC WEAPONS AND INTERACTED WITH DOD AND THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION (AEC) ON THESE ISSUES. TSD RAN PROJECT MKULTRA. HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION WAS DONE PRIOR TO MKULTRA BY OSI AND THE OFFICE OF SECURITY AND~ AFTER MKULTRA~ BY ORD. TO DATE~ CIA HAS FOUND NO RECORDS OR OTHER INFORMATION INDICATING THAT IT CONDUCTED OR SPONSORED HUMAN RADIATION EXPERIMENTS. IN RESPONSE TO 1/94~ PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE~ CIA CONDUCTED AN AGENCY-WIDE SEARCH ABOUT HUMAN RADIATION EXPERIMENTS THAT IT MAY HAVE CONDUCTED. AT COMMITTEE'S INITIAL MEETING IN 4/94~ CIA STATED THAT THE SEARCH ENCOMPASSED AN ELECTRONIC REVIEW OF APPROXIMATELY 34 MILLION DOCUMENTS~ A MANUAL REVIEW OF 480~300 DOCUMENTS~ AND NEARLY 50 INTERVIEWS. CIA ALSO STATED THAT IT HAD FOUND NO DOCUMENTS RELATING TO EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED BY OTHER AGENCIES.

ON 2/12/97 -- THE US INTERESTS SECTION SAID THE SR2 AIRCRAFT~ TURNED ON ITS SMOKE GENERATOR TO WARN A NEARBY CUBAN COMMERCIAL AIRLINER OF ITS PRESENCE IN THE REGION. THE SR2 USED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR THE FUMIGATION OF DRUG CROPS IS KNOWN TO HAVE TWO DISPERSION SYSTEMS: ONE FOR AEROSOLS AND LIQUID PARTICLES~ AND ONE FOR SOLID PARTICLES~ BUT IS NOT KNOWN TO CARRY A SMOKE GENERATOR. THE CUBAN PILOT WHO SPOTTED THE AIRCRAFT~ AND WHO HAS EXPERIENCE IN FUMIGATION SAID THAT THE US AIRCRAFT DID NOT LAUNCH SMOKE~ BUT RATHER A SUBSTANCE. RHC@RADIOHC.ORG 5/7/97

LOCATED 25 TO 30 KILO METRES SOUTH OF VARADERO. THE FLIGHT WAS A FUMIGATION AIRCRAFT MODEL SAR~ REGISTER N3093M~ OPERATED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT. THE AIRPLANE HAD TAKEN OFF FROM PATRICK AIR FORCE BASE~ BOUND FOR GRAND CAYMAN. THE CUBANA PILOT REPORTED TO FLIGHT CONTROL THE RELEASE OF UNKNOWN SUBSTANCES~ IN THE FORM OF A WHITE OR GREYISH MIST~ BY THE SAR AIRPLANE. 12/18/96~ THE FIRST SIGNS OF THRIPS PLAGUE APPEARED IN MATANZAS PROVINCE. AFTER A PROTEST NOTE ON 2/12/97~ THE US INTEREST SECTION IN HAVANA~ STATED~ THE PILOT HAD~ DURING HIS FLIGHT~ SEEN A CUBAN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE FLYING BELOW~ AND AS HE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF HAVING SEEN~ ^FOLLOWING CAUTION AND SAFETY PROCEDURES~^ AND WITH THE PURPOSE OF SECURING A POSITIVE VISUAL CONTACT~ THE PILOT USED THE ^SMOKE GENERATOR^ OF HIS AIRCRAFT~ IN ORDER TO ^INDICATE ITS LOCATION^ ADDING THAT ^THE SMOKE VANISHED AND NO FLUID WAS POURED FROM THE AIRPLANE.^ THE SAR AIRCRAFT~ REGISTER N3093M~ IS USED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING~ TO DESTROY CROPS. THE AIRCRAFT UTILIZES TWO SPRINKLING SYSTEMS: ONE FOR THE USE OF AEROSOLS AND LIQUID PARTICLES AND ANOTHER FOR DROPPING SOLID PARTICLES.

AT A MEETING HERE OF THE 138 NATIONS THAT SIGNED THE 1972 CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS~ CUBA DEMANDED AN INVESTIGATION INTO CLAIM THAT A U.S. STATE DEPT PLANE SPEWED AN AGENT KNOWN AS THRIPS PALMI OVER CUBA LAST OCTOBER. CHARGES PROVIDE A TEST FOR THE ACCORD~ INTENDED TO BAN GERM WARFARE. ACCORD NOW INCLUDES NO PROVISIONS FOR VERIFICATION OR ENFORCEMENT. NOW NEGOTIATORS TRYING TO ADD POWERS THAT WERE BUILT INTO THE POST-COLD WAR TREATIES TO BAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND NUCLEAR TEST EXPLOSIONS.

NOBEL PRIZE WINNER ON GULF WAR SYNDROME PANEL WAS ON BOARD OF SO-CALLED NON-PROFIT ENTITY THAT SOLD THE AGENTS. BUSH STOPPED SHIPMENTS WHEN HE CAME TO POWER. I AUTHORED AND BUSH SIGNED THE BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS ANTI-TERRORISM ACT OF 1989 MAKING THIS CRIMINAL UNDER US LAW. IT WAS PASSED UNANIMOUSLY BY BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS AND SIGNED INTO LAW BY BUSH IN JUNE OR SO OF 1989. ANY SHIPMENTS AFTER THAT WOULD BE INDICTABLE. BUSH PEOPLE KNEW THAT IRAQ HAD BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS BECAUSE WE GAVE THEM THE AGENTS. HENCE~ THEY ORDERED US TROOPS TO TAKE EXPERIMENTAL VACCINES IN VIOLATION OF THE NUREMBERG CODE ON MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION. VETS ARE STILL SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE COVER-UP. CURIOUSLY ENOUGH~ BOTH AMERICAN AND BRITISH TROOPS WERE GIVEN THE COCKTAIL OF INOCULATIONS AND HAVE THE SYNDROME. FRENCH TROOPS WERE NOT GIVEN INOCULATIONS AND THEY DO NOT HAVE IT.

AMONG THE U.S.-ORIGIN BIOLOGICAL AGENTS THAT OFTEN PRODUCE SLOW~ AGONIZING DEATHS WERE: BACILLUS ANTHRACIS~ CAUSE OF ANTHRAX; CLOSTRIDIUM BOTULINUM~ A SOURCE OF BOTULINUM TOXIN; HISTOPLASMA CAPSULATAM~ CAUSE OF A DISEASE ATTACKING LUNGS~ BRAIN~ SPINAL CORD AND HEART; BRUCELLA MELITENSIS~ A BACTERIA THAT CAN DAMAGE MAJOR ORGANS; CLOTSRIDIUM PERFRINGENS~ A HIGHLY TOXIC BACTERIA CAUSING SYSTEMIC ILLNESS; CLOSTRIDIUM TETANI~ HIGHLY TOXIGENIC; AND ESCHERICHIA COLI (E.COLI); GENETIC MATERIALS; AND HUMAN AND BACTERIAL DNA. IN LINE WITH THAT ANALYSIS~ EVEN AFTER THE PERSIAN GULF WAR~ WASHINGTON LOOKED TO THE EMERGENCE OF A PRO-U.S. LEADER TO REPLACE SADDAM~ NOT TO LESS MANAGEABLE POPULAR CHALLENGES.
